              "content": "# Full-text search functions [sql-functions-search]\n\nSearch functions should be used when performing full-text search, namely when the `MATCH` or `QUERY` predicates are being used. Outside a, so-called, search context, these functions will return default values such as `0` or `NULL`.\n\nElasticsearch SQL optimizes all queries executed against {{es}} depending on the scoring needs. Using [`track_scores`](/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/sort-search-results.md#_track_scores) on the search request or [`_doc` sorting](/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/sort-search-results.md) that disables scores calculation, Elasticsearch SQL instructs {{es}} not to compute scores when these are not needed. For example, every time a `SCORE()` function is encountered in the SQL query, the scores are computed.\n\n## `MATCH` [sql-functions-search-match]\n\n```sql\nMATCH(\n    field_exp,   <1>\n    constant_exp <2>\n    [, options]) <3>\n```\n\n**Input**:\n\n1. field(s) to match\n2. matching text\n3. additional parameters; optional\n\n\n**Description**: A full-text search option, in the form of a predicate, available in Elasticsearch SQL that gives the user control over powerful [match](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-match-query.md) and [multi_match](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-multi-match-query.md) {{es}} queries.\n\nThe first parameter is the field or fields to match against. In case it receives one value only, Elasticsearch SQL will use a `match` query to perform the search:\n\n```sql\nSELECT author, name FROM library WHERE MATCH(author, 'frank');\n\n    author     |       name\n---------------+-------------------\nFrank Herbert  |Dune\nFrank Herbert  |Dune Messiah\nFrank Herbert  |Children of Dune\nFrank Herbert  |God Emperor of Dune\n```\n\nHowever, it can also receive a list of fields and their corresponding optional `boost` value. In this case, Elasticsearch SQL will use a `multi_match` query to match the documents:\n\n```sql\nSELECT author, name, SCORE() FROM library WHERE MATCH('author^2,name^5', 'frank dune');\n\n    author     |       name        |    SCORE()\n---------------+-------------------+---------------\nFrank Herbert  |Dune               |11.443176\nFrank Herbert  |Dune Messiah       |9.446629\nFrank Herbert  |Children of Dune   |8.043278\nFrank Herbert  |God Emperor of Dune|7.0029488\n```\n\n::::{note}\nThe `multi_match` query in {{es}} has the option of [per-field boosting](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-multi-match-query.md) that gives preferential weight (in terms of scoring) to fields being searched in, using the `^` character. In the example above, the `name` field has a greater weight in the final score than the `author` field when searching for `frank dune` text in both of them.\n::::\n\n\nBoth options above can be used in combination with the optional third parameter of the `MATCH()` predicate, where one can specify additional configuration parameters (separated by semicolon `;`) for either `match` or `multi_match` queries. For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT author, name, SCORE() FROM library WHERE MATCH(name, 'to the star', 'operator=OR;fuzziness=AUTO:1,5;minimum_should_match=1')\nORDER BY SCORE() DESC LIMIT 2;\n\n     author      |                name                |    SCORE()\n-----------------+------------------------------------+---------------\nDouglas Adams    |The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|3.1756816\nPeter F. Hamilton|Pandora's Star                      |3.0997515\n```\n\n::::{note}\nThe allowed optional parameters for a single-field `MATCH()` variant (for the `match` {{es}} query) are: `analyzer`, `auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query`, `lenient`, `fuzziness`, `fuzzy_transpositions`, `fuzzy_rewrite`, `minimum_should_match`, `operator`, `max_expansions`, `prefix_length`.\n::::\n\n\n::::{note}\nThe allowed optional parameters for a multi-field `MATCH()` variant (for the `multi_match` {{es}} query) are: `analyzer`, `auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query`, `lenient`, `fuzziness`, `fuzzy_transpositions`, `fuzzy_rewrite`, `minimum_should_match`, `operator`, `max_expansions`, `prefix_length`, `slop`, `tie_breaker`, `type`.\n::::\n\n\n\n## `QUERY` [sql-functions-search-query]\n\n```sql\nQUERY(\n    constant_exp <1>\n    [, options]) <2>\n```\n\n**Input**:\n\n1. query text\n2. additional parameters; optional\n\n\n**Description**: Just like `MATCH`, `QUERY` is a full-text search predicate that gives the user control over the [query_string](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-query-string-query.md) query in {{es}}.\n\nThe first parameter is basically the input that will be passed as is to the `query_string` query, which means that anything that `query_string` accepts in its `query` field can be used here as well:\n\n```sql\nSELECT author, name, SCORE() FROM library WHERE QUERY('name:dune');\n\n    author     |       name        |    SCORE()\n---------------+-------------------+---------------\nFrank Herbert  |Dune               |2.2886353\nFrank Herbert  |Dune Messiah       |1.8893257\nFrank Herbert  |Children of Dune   |1.6086556\nFrank Herbert  |God Emperor of Dune|1.4005898\n```\n\nA more advanced example, showing more of the features that `query_string` supports, of course possible with Elasticsearch SQL:\n\n```sql\nSELECT author, name, page_count, SCORE() FROM library WHERE QUERY('_exists_:\"author\" AND page_count:>200 AND (name:/star.*/ OR name:duna~)');\n\n      author      |       name        |  page_count   |    SCORE()\n------------------+-------------------+---------------+---------------\nFrank Herbert     |Dune               |604            |3.7164764\nFrank Herbert     |Dune Messiah       |331            |3.4169943\nFrank Herbert     |Children of Dune   |408            |3.2064917\nFrank Herbert     |God Emperor of Dune|454            |3.0504425\nPeter F. Hamilton |Pandora's Star     |768            |3.0\nRobert A. Heinlein|Starship Troopers  |335            |3.0\n```\n\nThe query above uses the `_exists_` query to select documents that have values in the `author` field, a range query for `page_count` and regex and fuzziness queries for the `name` field.\n\nIf one needs to customize various configuration options that `query_string` exposes, this can be done using the second *optional* parameter. Multiple settings can be specified separated by a semicolon `;`:\n\n```sql\nSELECT author, name, SCORE() FROM library WHERE QUERY('dune god', 'default_operator=and;default_field=name');\n\n    author     |       name        |    SCORE()\n---------------+-------------------+---------------\nFrank Herbert  |God Emperor of Dune|3.6984892\n```\n\n::::{note}\nThe allowed optional parameters for `QUERY()` are: `allow_leading_wildcard`, `analyze_wildcard`, `analyzer`, `auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query`, `default_field`, `default_operator`, `enable_position_increments`, `escape`, `fuzziness`, `fuzzy_max_expansions`, `fuzzy_prefix_length`, `fuzzy_rewrite`, `fuzzy_transpositions`, `lenient`, `max_determinized_states`, `minimum_should_match`, `phrase_slop`, `rewrite`, `quote_analyzer`, `quote_field_suffix`, `tie_breaker`, `time_zone`, `type`.\n::::\n\n\n\n## `SCORE` [sql-functions-search-score]\n\n```sql\nSCORE()\n```\n\n**Input**: *none*\n\n**Output**: `double` numeric value\n\n**Description**: Returns the [relevance](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/2.x/relevance-intro.html) of a given input to the executed query. The higher score, the more relevant the data.\n\n::::{note}\nWhen doing multiple text queries in the `WHERE` clause then, their scores will be combined using the same rules as {{es}}'s [bool query](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-bool-query.md).\n::::\n\n\nTypically `SCORE` is used for ordering the results of a query based on their relevance:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SCORE(), * FROM library WHERE MATCH(name, 'dune') ORDER BY SCORE() DESC;\n\n    SCORE()    |    author     |       name        |  page_count   |    release_date\n---------------+---------------+-------------------+---------------+--------------------\n2.2886353      |Frank Herbert  |Dune               |604            |1965-06-01T00:00:00Z\n1.8893257      |Frank Herbert  |Dune Messiah       |331            |1969-10-15T00:00:00Z\n1.6086556      |Frank Herbert  |Children of Dune   |408            |1976-04-21T00:00:00Z\n1.4005898      |Frank Herbert  |God Emperor of Dune|454            |1981-05-28T00:00:00Z\n```\n\nHowever, it is perfectly fine to return the score without sorting by it:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SCORE() AS score, name, release_date FROM library WHERE QUERY('dune') ORDER BY YEAR(release_date) DESC;\n\n     score     |       name        |    release_date\n---------------+-------------------+--------------------\n1.4005898      |God Emperor of Dune|1981-05-28T00:00:00Z\n1.6086556      |Children of Dune   |1976-04-21T00:00:00Z\n1.8893257      |Dune Messiah       |1969-10-15T00:00:00Z\n2.2886353      |Dune               |1965-06-01T00:00:00Z\n```",

It serves as the default scripting language for Elasticsearch.\n\n2. **Usage**:\n   - Painless scripts can be used wherever scripting is enabled in Elasticsearch, such as in queries, aggregations, and updates. This includes functionalities like custom scoring logic, filtering results, and modifying documents during updates.\n\n3. **Performance**:\n   - Painless is optimized for speed and performance; it is designed to run faster than other scripting languages used in Elasticsearch, allowing for efficient processing of large datasets.\n\n4. **Features**:\n   - It supports both optional typing and dynamic typing, giving developers flexibility in how they declare and use variables.\n   - The syntax of Painless extends a subset of Java, making it easier for Java developers to adopt and utilize.\n\n5. **Integration with Elasticsearch**:\n   - You can employ Painless scripts to perform complex calculations, manipulate data during queries, and define custom filters to refine search results. For instance, a Painless script can return documents based on specific criteria (e.g., including only unsold items below a certain price).\n   - The API offers a variety of predefined variables, such as `params` (which enables users to pass parameters to scripts) and `doc` (which contains the fields of the current document).\n\n### Example of Painless Script Usage\n\nHere\u2019s a simple example of how to use a Painless script in a query context:\n\n```painless\ndoc['sold'].value == false && doc['cost'].value < params.cost\n```\nThis script checks if the `sold` field is false and if the `cost` is below a specified parameter value, thus controlling which documents are returned based on these criteria.\n\n### More Information\n\nFor a detailed guide on Painless, including syntax, built-in functions, and advanced usage, you may refer to the [Painless language documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/current/index.html) and the [Painless guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/current/painless-guide.html).\n\nYou can find all the relevant information within the Elasticsearch documentation located in their GitHub repository, specifically under:\n- [Painless Scripting Language](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/docs/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless.md)",
