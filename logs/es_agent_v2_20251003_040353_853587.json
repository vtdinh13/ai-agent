Declare an [array type](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless-types.md#array-type) variable using an opening `[` token and a closing `]` token for each dimension directly after the identifier. Specify a comma-separated list of identifiers following the type to declare multiple variables in a single statement. Use an [assignment operator](#variable-assignment) combined with a declaration to immediately assign a value to a variable. A variable not immediately assigned a value will have a default value assigned implicitly based on the type.\n\n**Errors**\n\n* If a variable is used prior to or without declaration.\n\n**Grammar**\n\n```text\ndeclaration : type ID assignment? (',' ID assignment?)*;\ntype: ID ('.' ID)* ('[' ']')*;\nassignment: '=' expression;\n```\n\n**Examples**\n\n* Different variations of variable declaration.\n\n    ```painless\n    int x;           <1>\n    List y;          <2>\n    int x, y = 5, z; <3>\n    def d;           <4>\n    int i = 10;      <5>\n    float[] f;       <6>\n    Map[][] m;       <7>\n    ```\n\n    1. declare `int x`; store default `null` to `x`\n    2. declare `List y`; store default `null` to `y`\n    3. declare `int x`; store default `int 0` to `x`; declare `int y`; store `int 5` to `y`; declare `int z`; store default `int 0` to `z`;\n    4. declare `def d`; store default `null` to `d`\n    5. declare `int i`; store `int 10` to `i`\n    6. declare `float[] f`; store default `null` to `f`\n    7. declare `Map[][] m`; store default `null` to `m`\n\n\n\n## Assignment [variable-assignment]\n\nUse the `assignment operator '='` to store a value in a variable for use in subsequent operations. Any operation that produces a value can be assigned to any variable as long as the [types](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless-types.md) are the same or the resultant type can be [implicitly cast](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless-casting.md) to the variable type.\n\n**Errors**\n\n* If the type of value is unable to match the type of variable.\n\n**Grammar**\n\n```text\nassignment: ID '=' expression\n```\n\n**Examples**\n\n* Variable assignment with an integer literal.\n\n    ```painless\n    int i;  <1>\n    i = 10; <2>\n    ```\n\n    1. declare `int i`; store default `int 0` to `i`\n    2. store `int 10` to `i`\n\n* Declaration combined with immediate assignment.\n\n    ```painless\n    int i = 10;     <1>\n    double j = 2.0; <2>\n    ```\n\n    1. declare `int i`; store `int 10` to `i`\n    2. declare `double j`; store `double 2.0` to `j`\n\n* Assignment of one variable to another using primitive type values.\n\n    ```painless\n    int i = 10; <1>\n    int j = i;  <2>\n    ```\n\n    1. declare `int i`; store `int 10` to `i`\n    2. declare `int j`; load from `i` \u2192 `int 10`; store `int 10` to `j`\n\n* Assignment with reference types using the [new instance operator](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless-operators-reference.md#new-instance-operator).\n\n    ```painless\n    ArrayList l = new ArrayList(); <1>\n    Map m = new HashMap();         <2>\n    ```\n\n    1. declare `ArrayList l`; allocate `ArrayList` instance \u2192 `ArrayList reference`; store `ArrayList reference` to `l`\n    2. declare `Map m`; allocate `HashMap` instance \u2192 `HashMap reference`; implicit cast `HashMap reference` to `Map reference` \u2192 `Map reference`; store `Map reference` to `m`\n\n* Assignment of one variable to another using reference type values.\n\n    ```painless\n    List l = new ArrayList(); <1>\n    List k = l;               <2>\n    List m;                   <3>\n    m = k;                    <4>\n    ```\n\n    1. declare `List l`; allocate `ArrayList` instance \u2192 `ArrayList reference`; implicit cast `ArrayList reference` to `List reference` \u2192 `List reference`; store `List reference` to `l`\n    2. declare `List k`; load from `l` \u2192 `List reference`; store `List reference` to `k`; (note `l` and `k` refer to the same instance known as a shallow-copy)\n    3. declare `List m`; store default `null` to `m`\n    4. load from `k` \u2192 `List reference`; store `List reference` to `m`; (note `l`, `k`, and `m` refer to the same instance)\n\n* Assignment with array type variables using the [new array operator](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless-operators-array.md#new-array-operator).\n\n    ```painless\n    int[] ia1;                   <1>\n    ia1 = new int[2];            <2>\n    ia1[0] = 1;                  <3>\n    int[] ib1 = ia1;             <4>\n    int[][] ic2 = new int[2][5]; <5>\n    ic2[1][3] = 2;               <6>\n    ic2[0] = ia1;                <7>\n    ```\n\n    1. declare `int[] ia1`; store default `null` to `ia1`\n    2. allocate `1-d int array` instance with `length [2]` \u2192 `1-d int array reference`; store `1-d int array reference` to `ia1`\n    3. load from `ia1` \u2192 `1-d int array reference`; store `int 1` to `index [0]` of `1-d int array reference`\n    4. declare `int[] ib1`; load from `ia1` \u2192 `1-d int array reference`; store `1-d int array reference` to `ib1`; (note `ia1` and `ib1` refer to the same instance known as a shallow copy)\n    5. declare `int[][] ic2`; allocate `2-d int array` instance with `length [2, 5]` \u2192 `2-d int array reference`; store `2-d int array reference` to `ic2`\n    6. load from `ic2` \u2192 `2-d int array reference`; store `int 2` to `index [1, 3]` of `2-d int array reference`\n    7. load from `ia1` \u2192 `1-d int array reference`; load from `ic2` \u2192 `2-d int array reference`; store `1-d int array reference` to `index [0]` of `2-d int array reference`; (note `ia1`, `ib1`, and `index [0]` of `ia2` refer to the same instance)",

              "content": "# Significant text aggregation [search-aggregations-bucket-significanttext-aggregation]\n\n\nAn aggregation that returns interesting or unusual occurrences of free-text terms in a set. It is like the [significant terms](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.md) aggregation but differs in that:\n\n* It is specifically designed for use on type `text` fields\n* It does not require field data or doc-values\n* It re-analyzes text content on-the-fly meaning it can also filter duplicate sections of noisy text that otherwise tend to skew statistics.\n\n::::{warning}\nRe-analyzing *large* result sets will require a lot of time and memory. It is recommended that the significant_text aggregation is used as a child of either the [sampler](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-sampler-aggregation.md) or [diversified sampler](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-diversified-sampler-aggregation.md) aggregation to limit the analysis to a *small* selection of top-matching documents e.g. 200. This will typically improve speed, memory use and quality of results.\n::::\n\n\n* Suggesting \"H5N1\" when users search for \"bird flu\" to help expand queries\n* Suggesting keywords relating to stock symbol $ATI for use in an automated news classifier\n\nIn these cases the words being selected are not simply the most popular terms in results. The most popular words tend to be very boring (*and, of, the, we, I, they* \u2026 ). The significant words are the ones that have undergone a significant change in popularity measured between a *foreground* and *background* set. If the term \"H5N1\" only exists in 5 documents in a 10 million document index and yet is found in 4 of the 100 documents that make up a user\u2019s search results that is significant and probably very relevant to their search. 5/10,000,000 vs 4/100 is a big swing in frequency.\n\n## Basic use [_basic_use_2]\n\nIn the typical use case, the *foreground* set of interest is a selection of the top-matching search results for a query and the *background* set used for statistical comparisons is the index or indices from which the results were gathered.\n\nExample:\n\n$$$significanttext-aggregation-example$$$\n\n```console\nGET news/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": { \"content\": \"Bird flu\" }\n  },\n  \"aggregations\": {\n    \"my_sample\": {\n      \"sampler\": {\n        \"shard_size\": 100\n      },\n      \"aggregations\": {\n        \"keywords\": {\n          \"significant_text\": { \"field\": \"content\" }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nResponse:\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"took\": 9,\n  \"timed_out\": false,\n  \"_shards\": ...,\n  \"hits\": ...,\n    \"aggregations\" : {\n        \"my_sample\": {\n            \"doc_count\": 100,\n            \"keywords\" : {\n                \"doc_count\": 100,\n                \"buckets\" : [\n                    {\n                        \"key\": \"h5n1\",\n                        \"doc_count\": 4,\n                        \"score\": 4.71235374214817,\n                        \"bg_count\": 5\n                    }\n                    ...\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe results show that \"h5n1\" is one of several terms strongly associated with bird flu. It only occurs 5 times in our index as a whole (see the `bg_count`) and yet 4 of these were lucky enough to appear in our 100 document sample of \"bird flu\" results. That suggests a significant word and one which the user can potentially add to their search.\n\n\n## Dealing with noisy data using `filter_duplicate_text` [filter-duplicate-text-noisy-data]\n\nFree-text fields often contain a mix of original content and mechanical copies of text (cut-and-paste biographies, email reply chains, retweets, boilerplate headers/footers, page navigation menus, sidebar news links, copyright notices, standard disclaimers, addresses).\n\nIn real-world data these duplicate sections of text tend to feature heavily in `significant_text` results if they aren\u2019t filtered out. Filtering near-duplicate text is a difficult task at index-time but we can cleanse the data on-the-fly at query time using the `filter_duplicate_text` setting.\n\nFirst let\u2019s look at an unfiltered real-world example using the [Signal media dataset](https://research.signalmedia.co/newsir16/signal-dataset.md) of a million news articles covering a wide variety of news. Here are the raw significant text results for a search for the articles mentioning \"elasticsearch\":\n\n```js\n{\n  ...\n  \"aggregations\": {\n    \"sample\": {\n      \"doc_count\": 35,\n      \"keywords\": {\n        \"doc_count\": 35,\n        \"buckets\": [\n          {\n            \"key\": \"elasticsearch\",\n            \"doc_count\": 35,\n            \"score\": 28570.428571428572,\n            \"bg_count\": 35\n          },\n          ...\n          {\n            \"key\": \"currensee\",\n            \"doc_count\": 8,\n            \"score\": 6530.383673469388,\n            \"bg_count\": 8\n          },\n          ...\n          {\n            \"key\": \"pozmantier\",\n            \"doc_count\": 4,\n            \"score\": 3265.191836734694,\n            \"bg_count\": 4\n          },\n          ...\n\n}\n```\n\nThe uncleansed documents have thrown up some odd-looking terms that are, on the face of it, statistically correlated with appearances of our search term \"elasticsearch\" e.g. \"pozmantier\". We can drill down into examples of these documents to see why pozmantier is connected using this query:\n\n$$$significanttext-aggregation-pozmantier-example$$$\n\n```console\nGET news/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"simple_query_string\": {\n      \"query\": \"+elasticsearch  +pozmantier\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"_source\": [\n    \"title\",\n    \"source\"\n  ],\n  \"highlight\": {\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"content\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe results show a series of very similar news articles about a judging panel for a number of tech projects:\n\n```js\n{\n  ...\n  \"hits\": {\n    \"hits\": [\n      {\n        ...\n        \"_source\": {\n          \"source\": \"Presentation Master\",\n          \"title\": \"T.E.N.

Let\u2019s try this same query now but with the `filter_duplicate_text` setting turned on:\n\n$$$significanttext-aggregation-filter-duplicate-text-example$$$\n\n```console\nGET news/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"content\": \"elasticsearch\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"sample\": {\n      \"sampler\": {\n        \"shard_size\": 100\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"keywords\": {\n          \"significant_text\": {\n            \"field\": \"content\",\n            \"filter_duplicate_text\": true\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe results from analysing our deduplicated text are obviously of higher quality to anyone familiar with the elastic stack:\n\n```js\n{\n  ...\n  \"aggregations\": {\n    \"sample\": {\n      \"doc_count\": 35,\n      \"keywords\": {\n        \"doc_count\": 35,\n        \"buckets\": [\n          {\n            \"key\": \"elasticsearch\",\n            \"doc_count\": 22,\n            \"score\": 11288.001166180758,\n            \"bg_count\": 35\n          },\n          {\n            \"key\": \"logstash\",\n            \"doc_count\": 3,\n            \"score\": 1836.648979591837,\n            \"bg_count\": 4\n          },\n          {\n            \"key\": \"kibana\",\n            \"doc_count\": 3,\n            \"score\": 1469.3020408163263,\n            \"bg_count\": 5\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nMr Pozmantier and other one-off associations with elasticsearch no longer appear in the aggregation results as a consequence of copy-and-paste operations or other forms of mechanical repetition.\n\nIf your duplicate or near-duplicate content is identifiable via a single-value indexed field  (perhaps a hash of the article\u2019s `title` text or an `original_press_release_url` field) then it would be more efficient to use a parent [diversified sampler](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-diversified-sampler-aggregation.md) aggregation to eliminate these documents from the sample set based on that single key. The less duplicate content you can feed into the significant_text aggregation up front the better in terms of performance.\n\n::::{admonition} How are the significance scores calculated?\nThe numbers returned for scores are primarily intended for ranking different suggestions sensibly rather than something easily understood by end users. The scores are derived from the doc frequencies in *foreground* and *background* sets. In brief, a term is considered significant if there is a noticeable difference in the frequency in which a term appears in the subset and in the background. The way the terms are ranked can be configured, see \"Parameters\" section.\n\n::::\n\n\n::::{admonition} Use the \"like this but not this\" pattern\nYou can spot mis-categorized content by first searching a structured field e.g. `category:adultMovie` and use significant_text on the text \"movie_description\" field. Take the suggested words (I\u2019ll leave them to your imagination) and then search for all movies NOT marked as category:adultMovie but containing these keywords. You now have a ranked list of badly-categorized movies that you should reclassify or at least remove from the \"familyFriendly\" category.\n\nThe significance score from each term can also provide a useful `boost` setting to sort matches. Using the `minimum_should_match` setting of the `terms` query with the keywords will help control the balance of precision/recall in the result set i.e a high setting would have a small number of relevant results packed full of keywords and a setting of \"1\" would produce a more exhaustive results set with all documents containing *any* keyword.\n\n::::\n\n\n\n## Limitations [_limitations_9]\n\n### No support for child aggregations [_no_support_for_child_aggregations]\n\nThe significant_text aggregation intentionally does not support the addition of child aggregations because:\n\n* It would come with a high memory cost\n* It isn\u2019t a generally useful feature and there is a workaround for those that need it\n\nThe volume of candidate terms is generally very high and these are pruned heavily before the final results are returned. Supporting child aggregations would generate additional churn and be inefficient. Clients can always take the heavily-trimmed set of results from a `significant_text` request and make a subsequent follow-up query using a `terms` aggregation with an `include` clause and child aggregations to perform further analysis of selected keywords in a more efficient fashion.\n\n\n### No support for nested objects [_no_support_for_nested_objects]\n\nThe significant_text aggregation currently also cannot be used with text fields in nested objects, because it works with the document JSON source. This makes this feature inefficient when matching nested docs from stored JSON given a matching Lucene docID.\n\n\n### Approximate counts [_approximate_counts_2]\n\nThe counts of how many documents contain a term provided in results are based on summing the samples returned from each shard and as such may be:\n\n* low if certain shards did not provide figures for a given term in their top sample\n* high when considering the background frequency as it may count occurrences found in deleted documents\n\nLike most design decisions, this is the basis of a trade-off in which we have chosen to provide fast performance at the cost of some (typically small) inaccuracies. However, the `size` and `shard size` settings covered in the next section provide tools to help control the accuracy levels.\n\n\n\n## Parameters [significanttext-aggregation-parameters]\n\n### Significance heuristics [_significance_heuristics]\n\nThis aggregation supports the same scoring heuristics (JLH, mutual_information, gnd, chi_square etc) as the [significant terms](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-significantterms-aggregation.md) aggregation\n\n\n### Size & Shard Size [sig-text-shard-size]\n\nThe `size` parameter can be set to define how many term buckets should be returned out of the overall terms list. By default, the node coordinating the search process will request each shard to provide its own top term buckets and once all shards respond, it will reduce the results to the final list that will then be returned to the client. If the number of unique terms is greater than `size`, the returned list can be slightly off and not accurate (it could be that the term counts are slightly off and it could even be that a term that should have been in the top size buckets was not returned).\n\nTo ensure better accuracy a multiple of the final `size` is used as the number of terms to request from each shard (`2 * (size * 1.5 + 10)`). To take manual control of this setting the `shard_size` parameter can be used to control the volumes of candidate terms produced by each shard.\n\nLow-frequency terms can turn out to be the most interesting ones once all results are combined so the significant_terms aggregation can produce higher-quality results when the `shard_size` parameter is set to values significantly higher than the `size` setting. This ensures that a bigger volume of promising candidate terms are given a consolidated review by the reducing node before the final selection. Obviously large candidate term lists will cause extra network traffic and RAM usage so this is quality/cost trade off that needs to be balanced. If `shard_size` is set to -1 (the default) then `shard_size` will be automatically estimated based on the number of shards and the `size` parameter.\n\n::::{note}\n`shard_size` cannot be smaller than `size` (as it doesn\u2019t make much sense). When it is, elasticsearch will override it and reset it to be equal to `size`.\n::::\n\n\n\n### Minimum document count [_minimum_document_count_3]\n\nIt is possible to only return terms that match more than a configured number of hits using the `min_doc_count` option. The Default value is 3.\n\nTerms that score highly will be collected on a shard level and merged with the terms collected from other shards in a second step. However, the shard does not have the information about the global term frequencies available. The decision if a term is added to a candidate list depends only on the score computed on the shard using local shard frequencies, not the global frequencies of the word. The `min_doc_count` criterion is only applied after merging local terms statistics of all shards. In a way the decision to add the term as a candidate is made without being very *certain* about if the term will actually reach the required `min_doc_count`. This might cause many (globally) high frequent terms to be missing in the final result if low frequent but high scoring terms populated the candidate lists. To avoid this, the `shard_size` parameter can be increased to allow more candidate terms on the shards. However, this increases memory consumption and network traffic.\n\n#### `shard_min_doc_count` [search-aggregations-bucket-significanttext-shard-min-doc-count]\n\nThe parameter `shard_min_doc_count` regulates the *certainty* a shard has if the term should actually be added to the candidate list or not with respect to the `min_doc_count`. Terms will only be considered if their local shard frequency within the set is higher than the `shard_min_doc_count`. If your dictionary contains many low frequent terms and you are not interested in those (for example misspellings), then you can set the `shard_min_doc_count` parameter to filter out candidate terms on a shard level that will with a reasonable certainty not reach the required `min_doc_count` even after merging the local counts. `shard_min_doc_count` is set to `0` per default and has no effect unless you explicitly set it.\n\n::::{warning}\nSetting `min_doc_count` to `1` is generally not advised as it tends to return terms that are typos or other bizarre curiosities. Finding more than one instance of a term helps reinforce that, while still rare, the term was not the result of a one-off accident. The default value of 3 is used to provide a minimum weight-of-evidence. Setting `shard_min_doc_count` too high will cause significant candidate terms to be filtered out on a shard level. This value should be set much lower than `min_doc_count/#shards`.\n::::\n\n\n\n\n### Custom background context [_custom_background_context_2]\n\nThe default source of statistical information for background term frequencies is the entire index and this scope can be narrowed through the use of a `background_filter` to focus in on significant terms within a narrower context:\n\n$$$significanttext-aggregation-custom-background-example$$$\n\n```console\nGET news/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"content\": \"madrid\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"tags\": {\n      \"significant_text\": {\n        \"field\": \"content\",\n        \"background_filter\": {\n          \"term\": { \"content\": \"spain\" }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe above filter would help focus in on terms that were peculiar to the city of Madrid rather than revealing terms like \"Spanish\" that are unusual in the full index\u2019s worldwide context but commonplace in the subset of documents containing the word \"Spain\".\n\n::::{warning}\nUse of background filters will slow the query as each term\u2019s postings must be filtered to determine a frequency\n::::\n\n\n\n### Dealing with source and index mappings [_dealing_with_source_and_index_mappings]\n\nOrdinarily the indexed field name and the original JSON field being retrieved share the same name. However with more complex field mappings using features like `copy_to` the source JSON field(s) and the indexed field being aggregated can differ. In these cases it is possible to list the JSON _source fields from which text will be analyzed using the `source_fields` parameter:\n\n$$$significanttext-aggregation-mappings-example$$$\n\n```console\nGET news/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"custom_all\": \"elasticsearch\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"tags\": {\n      \"significant_text\": {\n        \"field\": \"custom_all\",\n        \"source_fields\": [ \"content\", \"title\" ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Filtering Values [_filtering_values_3]\n\nIt is possible (although rarely required) to filter the values for which buckets will be created. This can be done using the `include` and `exclude` parameters which are based on a regular expression string or arrays of exact terms. This functionality mirrors the features described in the [terms aggregation](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.md) documentation.",

The aggregation type is `extended_stats` and the `field` setting defines the numeric field of the documents the stats will be computed on. The above will return the following:\n\nThe `std_deviation` and `variance` are calculated as population metrics so they are always the same as `std_deviation_population` and `variance_population` respectively.\n\n```console-result\n{\n  ...\n\n  \"aggregations\": {\n    \"grades_stats\": {\n      \"count\": 2,\n      \"min\": 50.0,\n      \"max\": 100.0,\n      \"avg\": 75.0,\n      \"sum\": 150.0,\n      \"sum_of_squares\": 12500.0,\n      \"variance\": 625.0,\n      \"variance_population\": 625.0,\n      \"variance_sampling\": 1250.0,\n      \"std_deviation\": 25.0,\n      \"std_deviation_population\": 25.0,\n      \"std_deviation_sampling\": 35.35533905932738,\n      \"std_deviation_bounds\": {\n        \"upper\": 125.0,\n        \"lower\": 25.0,\n        \"upper_population\": 125.0,\n        \"lower_population\": 25.0,\n        \"upper_sampling\": 145.71067811865476,\n        \"lower_sampling\": 4.289321881345245\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe name of the aggregation (`grades_stats` above) also serves as the key by which the aggregation result can be retrieved from the returned response.\n\n## Standard Deviation Bounds [_standard_deviation_bounds]\n\nBy default, the `extended_stats` metric will return an object called `std_deviation_bounds`, which provides an interval of plus/minus two standard deviations from the mean. This can be a useful way to visualize variance of your data. If you want a different boundary, for example three standard deviations, you can set `sigma` in the request:\n\n```console\nGET /exams/_search\n{\n  \"size\": 0,\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"grades_stats\": {\n      \"extended_stats\": {\n        \"field\": \"grade\",\n        \"sigma\": 3          <1>\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n1. `sigma` controls how many standard deviations +/- from the mean should be displayed\n\n\n`sigma` can be any non-negative double, meaning you can request non-integer values such as `1.5`. A value of `0` is valid, but will simply return the average for both `upper` and `lower` bounds.\n\nThe `upper` and `lower` bounds are calculated as population metrics so they are always the same as `upper_population` and `lower_population` respectively.\n\n::::{admonition} Standard Deviation and Bounds require normality\n:class: note\n\nThe standard deviation and its bounds are displayed by default, but they are not always applicable to all data-sets. Your data must be normally distributed for the metrics to make sense. The statistics behind standard deviations assumes normally distributed data, so if your data is skewed heavily left or right, the value returned will be misleading.\n\n::::\n\n\n\n## Script [_script_5]\n\nIf you need to aggregate on a value that isn\u2019t indexed, use a [runtime field](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/mapping/runtime-fields.md). Say the we found out that the grades we\u2019ve been working on were for an exam that was above the level of the students and we want to \"correct\" it:\n\n```console\nGET /exams/_search\n{\n  \"size\": 0,\n  \"runtime_mappings\": {\n    \"grade.corrected\": {\n      \"type\": \"double\",\n      \"script\": {\n        \"source\": \"emit(Math.min(100, doc['grade'].value * params.correction))\",\n        \"params\": {\n          \"correction\": 1.2\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"grades_stats\": {\n      \"extended_stats\": { \"field\": \"grade.corrected\" }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## Missing value [_missing_value_9]\n\nThe `missing` parameter defines how documents that are missing a value should be treated. By default they will be ignored but it is also possible to treat them as if they had a value.\n\n```console\nGET /exams/_search\n{\n  \"size\": 0,\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"grades_stats\": {\n      \"extended_stats\": {\n        \"field\": \"grade\",\n        \"missing\": 0        <1>\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n1. Documents without a value in the `grade` field will fall into the same bucket as documents that have the value `0`.",

              "content": "# Data modelling tips [mapper-annotated-text-tips]\n\n## Use structured and unstructured fields [_use_structured_and_unstructured_fields]\n\nAnnotations are normally a way of weaving structured information into unstructured text for higher-precision search.\n\n`Entity resolution` is a form of document enrichment undertaken by specialist software or people where references to entities in a document are disambiguated by attaching a canonical ID. The ID is used to resolve any number of aliases or distinguish between people with the same name. The hyperlinks connecting Wikipedia\u2019s articles are a good example of resolved entity IDs woven into text.\n\nThese IDs can be embedded as annotations in an annotated_text field but it often makes sense to include them in dedicated structured fields to support discovery via aggregations:\n\n```console\nPUT my-index-000001\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"my_unstructured_text_field\": {\n        \"type\": \"annotated_text\"\n      },\n      \"my_structured_people_field\": {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"fields\": {\n          \"keyword\" : {\n            \"type\": \"keyword\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nApplications would then typically provide content and discover it as follows:\n\n```console\n# Example documents\nPUT my-index-000001/_doc/1\n{\n  \"my_unstructured_text_field\": \"[Shay](%40kimchy) created elasticsearch\",\n  \"my_twitter_handles\": [\"@kimchy\"] <1>\n}\n\nGET my-index-000001/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query_string\": {\n        \"query\": \"elasticsearch OR logstash OR kibana\",<2>\n        \"default_field\": \"my_unstructured_text_field\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"aggregations\": {\n  \t\"top_people\" :{\n  \t    \"significant_terms\" : { <3>\n\t       \"field\" : \"my_twitter_handles.keyword\"\n  \t    }\n  \t}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n1. Note the `my_twitter_handles` contains a list of the annotation values also used in the unstructured text. (Note the annotated_text syntax requires escaping). By repeating the annotation values in a structured field this application has ensured that the tokens discovered in the structured field can be used for search and highlighting in the unstructured field.\n2. In this example we search for documents that talk about components of the elastic stack\n3. We use the `my_twitter_handles` field here to discover people who are significantly associated with the elastic stack.\n\n\n\n## Avoiding over-matching annotations [_avoiding_over_matching_annotations]\n\nBy design, the regular text tokens and the annotation tokens co-exist in the same indexed field but in rare cases this can lead to some over-matching.\n\nThe value of an annotation often denotes a *named entity* (a person, place or company). The tokens for these named entities are inserted untokenized, and differ from typical text tokens because they are normally:\n\n* Mixed case e.g. `Madonna`\n* Multiple words e.g. `Jeff Beck`\n* Can have punctuation or numbers e.g. `Apple Inc.` or `@kimchy`\n\nThis means, for the most part, a search for a named entity in the annotated text field will not have any false positives e.g. when selecting `Apple Inc.` from an aggregation result you can drill down to highlight uses in the text without \"over matching\" on any text tokens like the word `apple` in this context:\n\n```\nthe apple was very juicy\n```\nHowever, a problem arises if your named entity happens to be a single term and lower-case e.g. the company `elastic`. In this case, a search on the annotated text field for the token `elastic` may match a text document such as this:\n\n```\nthey fired an elastic band\n```\nTo avoid such false matches users should consider prefixing annotation values to ensure they don\u2019t name clash with text tokens e.g.\n\n```\n[elastic](Company_elastic) released version 7.0 of the elastic stack today\n```",
