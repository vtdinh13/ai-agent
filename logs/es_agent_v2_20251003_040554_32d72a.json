However, some improvements require changes that are not compatible with previous versions.\n\nWhen an API is targeted for removal or is going to be changed in a non-compatible way, the original API is deprecated for one or more releases. Using the original API triggers a deprecation warning in the logs. This enables you to review the deprecation logs  and take the appropriate actions before upgrading. However, in some cases it is difficult to identify all places where deprecated APIs are being used. This is where REST API compatibility can help.\n\nWhen you request REST API compatibility, {{es}} attempts to honor the previous REST API version. {{es}} attempts to apply the most compatible URL, request body, response body, and HTTP parameters.\n\nFor compatible APIs, this has no effect\u2014 it only impacts calls to APIs that have breaking changes from the previous version. An error can still be returned in compatibility mode if {{es}} cannot automatically resolve the incompatibilities.\n\n::::{important}\nREST API compatibility does not guarantee the same behavior as the prior version. It instructs {{es}} to automatically resolve any incompatibilities so the request can be processed instead of returning an error.\n::::\n\n\nREST API compatibility should be a bridge to smooth out the upgrade process, not a long term strategy. REST API compatibility is only honored across one major version: honor 8.x requests/responses from 9.x.\n\nWhen you submit requests using REST API compatibility and {{es}} resolves the incompatibility, a message is written to the deprecation log with the category \"compatible_api\". Review the deprecation log to identify any gaps in usage and fully supported features.\n\n\n## Requesting REST API compatibility [request-rest-api-compatibility]\n\nREST API compatibility is implemented per request via the Accept and/or Content-Type headers.\n\nFor example:\n\n```text\nAccept: \"application/vnd.elasticsearch+json;compatible-with=8\"\nContent-Type: \"application/vnd.elasticsearch+json;compatible-with=8\"\n```\n\nThe Accept header is always required and the Content-Type header is only required when a body is sent with the request. The following values are valid when communicating with a 8.x or 9.x {{es}} server:\n\n```text\n\"application/vnd.elasticsearch+json;compatible-with=8\"\n\"application/vnd.elasticsearch+yaml;compatible-with=8\"\n\"application/vnd.elasticsearch+smile;compatible-with=8\"\n\"application/vnd.elasticsearch+cbor;compatible-with=8\"\n```\n\nThe [officially supported {{es}} clients](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html) can enable REST API compatibility for all requests.\n\nTo enable REST API compatibility for all requests received by {{es}} set the environment variable `ELASTIC_CLIENT_APIVERSIONING` to true.\n\n\n## REST API compatibility workflow [_rest_api_compatibility_workflow]\n\nTo leverage REST API compatibility during an upgrade from the last 8.x to {{version.stack}}:\n\n1.

              "content": "#  REST API compatibility developers guide\n\nREST API compatibility is intended to minimize the impact for breaking changes applied to the REST API. Compatibility is implemented to strike a balance between preserving the REST API contract across major versions while still allowing for breaking changes. URL paths, parameters, HTTP verbs, request bodies and response bodies are all covered by REST API compatibility.\n\n### Example use case\n\nThe recommended procedure to upgrade Elasticsearch to a new major version is to first upgrade Elasticsearch (the server), then upgrade any of the consumers/clients. This implies that the consumers/clients during and immediately after an upgrade may still be attempting to communicate with Elasticsearch using the prior major version's REST API contract.  During this time, without compatibility, if any of consumers/clients continue to call into one of the REST API's that include breaking changes, the consumer/client can also break.  Compatibility is a best attempt to honor the spirit of the original API call even after the breaking change has been applied.\n\nFor example, assume a REST request requires a consumer to send a \"limit\" parameter in the body of the request. Elasticsearch (the server) is upgraded to the next major version and that major version made a non-passive change that removes \"limit\" in favor of a \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" fields to enable some new functionality to also support a new lower limit. After the major version upgrade Elasticsearch only knows about \"minimum\" and \"maximum\", but the consumer/client (still on the older version of the client) only knows about \"limit\". With REST API compatibility the consumer/client can continue to send \"limit\" and Elasticsearch will honor that request using the value of \"limit\" as the \"maximum\".  Since the prior version had no notion of \"minimum\",  mapping \"limit\" -> \"maximum\" is the best attempt to honor the spirit of the request while still allowing the API and underlying behavior to evolve.  A warning will be emitted to let the consumer/client know Elasticsearch applied compatibility.\n\n### Workflow\n\nREST API compatibility is opt-in per request using a specialized value for the `Accept` or `Content-Type` HTTP header.  The intent is that this header may be sent prior to a major version upgrade resulting in no differences with the standard header values when the client and server match versions. For example, assume the consumer/client using the REST API for Elasticsearch version 7.  If the client sends the specialized header value(s) for compatibility with version 7, then it will have no effect when talking with Elasticsearch version 7. However, once Elasticsearch is upgraded to version 8, and the compatibility with version 7 headers are sent, then Elasticsearch version 8 attempts to honor the version 7 REST API contract. This allows Elasticsearch to be upgraded to version 8 while the clients can generally remain on version 7. It is not always guaranteed to fix all upgrade issues but should provide an additional level of confidence during/post upgrade.\n\nBreaking changes always follow a life-cycle of deprecation (documentation and warnings) in the current version before implementing the breaking change in the next major version. This give users an opportunity to adopt the non-deprecated variants in the current version. It is the still recommended approach to stop the usage of all deprecated functionality prior to a major version upgrade. However, in practice this can be a difficult, error prone, and a time consuming task. So it also recommended that consumers/clients send the specialized header to enable REST API compatibility before an upgrade to help catch any missed usages of deprecated functionality.\n\n### Specialized header\n\nREST API compatibility is enabled per request using a specialized HTTP header.\n\nFor a request without a body the following Accept header is required to request REST API compatibility:\n\n```javascript\nAccept: \"application/vnd.elasticsearch+json;compatible-with=7\"\n```\n\nIf the request also has a body the following is also necessary\n\n```javascript\nContent-Type: \"application/vnd.elasticsearch+json;compatible-with=7\"\n```\n\nThe headers mirrors the 4 supported media types for both the `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers.\n\n```javascript\n\"application/vnd.elasticsearch+json;compatible-with=7\"\n\"application/vnd.elasticsearch+yaml;compatible-with=7\"\n\"application/vnd.elasticsearch+smile;compatible-with=7\"\n\"application/vnd.elasticsearch+cbor;compatible-with=7\"\n```\n\nThe version request is found in compatible-with=7. When sent to a version 7 server will do nothing special. When sent to a version 8 server will apply compatiblity if needed. When sent to a version 9 server will fail since compatibility is only supported across 1 major version.\n\nA consumer/client may not mix \"compatible-with\" versions between headers. Attempts to mix and match compatible versions between `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers will result in an error.  A consumer/client may mix the media type (i.e. send `yaml` and get back `json`).\n\n\n## Introducing breaking changes to the REST API\n\nThe remainder of this guide is intended to help Elasticsearch developers understand how to introduce breaking changes to the REST API with support for REST API compatibility.\n\n### When to apply\n\nAny changes that touch the URL path,  URL parameters, HTTP verbs, the shape or response code for the non-error response, the shape of the request should account for REST API compatibility.  REST API compatibility is first introduced with version 8 with compatibility back to version 7.  The 7.x branch of code has some minimal support to allow for easy back porting and to allow for the reading of the header on a version 7 cluster. There are no plans to provide compatibility back to version 6.\n\nREST API compatibility is not the same as a fully version-ed API. It is a best attempt find a compatible way to honor the prior major version REST API contract. There will be cases where it is not possible to apply a compatibility. In those cases a meaningful error message should be emitted.\n\n### When not to apply\n\nSettings, SQL, scripting, CAT APIs, and errors messages all touch the REST API but are not covered by REST API compatibility.\n\n### Implementation\n\nThere are 4 primary integration points with REST API compatibility.\n\n*  Serializing responses to xContent\n*  De-serializing requests from xContent\n*  URL path, URL parameters, and HTTP verbs\n*  Testing for compatibility\n\n### Serializing\n\nEmitting a response back to the client is generally done via the `ToXContent#toXContent` method. The requested compatibility can be found in the `XContentBuilder` object allowing for conditional logic based on a specific request. For example:\n\n```java\n    if (builder.getRestApiVersion() == RestApiVersion.V_7) {\n        builder.field(\"limit\", max);\n    } else {\n        builder.field(\"maximum,\", max);\n        builder.field(\"minimum\", min);\n    }\n```\n\nIn some cases the `ToXContent#toXContent` is also used to serialize the values to the cluster state.  In these cases some refactoring or additional runtime validation is necessary to prevent the REST API conditional serialization from persisting in cluster state.\n\nIn places where `ToXContent#toXContent` is not used for serialization, then the requested compatibility can also be found in the `RestRequest` object and used accordingly. It is generally discouraged to push the requested compatibility version down through the transport actions to keep the REST compatibility a REST layer concern.\n\n### De-serializing\n\nAccepting a payload from a prior version's REST request is a bit more difficult than sending a compatible response. There are a couple different approaches for de-serialization, however, in general all of them use a request specific parser.  `XContentParser` has a `getRestApiVersion()` method that could be used in manner that is near identical to serialization. However, in practice most parsers are invoked via a `ConstructingObjectParser` or an `ObjectParser` and quite often they are daisy chained together via the `NamedXContentRegistry`.\n\nBoth `ConstructingObjectParser` and `ObjectParser` use `ParseField`'s to statically declare the relationship between a named key and value pairing. A parser via it's `ParseField` can be made version aware, meaning that the parser will match on the incoming payload if the requested compatibility is the correct version.\n\nFor example:\n\n```java\nPARSER.declareInt(MyPojo::setMax, new ParseField(\"maximum\", \"limit\").forRestApiVersion(RestApiVersion.equalTo(RestApiVersion.V_7)));\nPARSER.declareInt(MyPojo::setMax, new ParseField(\"maximum\").forRestApiVersion(RestApiVersion.onOrAfter(RestApiVersion.V_8)));\n```\n\nThe above example is for code that live in the version 8 branch of code. In this example, `limit` has been deprecated in version 7 and removed in version 8.  The above code reads use the `maximum` value from the request for both version 7 and version 8. However, if compatibility is requested it will also allow `limit` in the payload.  If `limit` is used a warning will be emitted.\n\nThe version in `forRestApiVersion` is reference to when the declaration is valid. Assuming version 8 is the main branch and all changes start in the main branch then get back ported. The above text is what would be applicable for the v8 branch of code. The first line of code is essentially ignored except for when compatibility with version 7 is requested. When back-porting this change to the 7.x branch, the first line would be identical, and the second line would be omitted.\n\nThe above strategy works well for single fields, but could get overly complex very fast for large multiple field changes. For more complex de-serialization changes there is also support to construct a `NamedXContentRegistry` with some \"normal\" entries as well some entries that are only applied when compatibility with the prior version is requested. The syntax is very similar where can express the desired version from the required `ParseField` when adding an entry to the `NamedXContentRegistry`.\n\nAdditionally, there is a pseudo standard method `fromXContent` which also generally has access to the `XContentParser` for that request which can be used to conditionally change how to parse the input.\n\n```java\nprivate static final ParseField limitField = new ParseField(\"maximum\", \"limit\").forRestApiVersion(RestApiVersion.equalTo(RestApiVersion.V_7));\n\n//call to fromXContent\nMyExample.fromXContent(XContentType.JSON.xContent().createParser(XContentParserConfiguration.EMPTY.withDeprecationHandler(LoggingDeprecationHandler.INSTANCE).withRestApiVersion(request.getRestApiVersion()), \" { \\\"limit\\\" : 99 }\"));\n\n//contents of a fromXContent\nwhile ((token = parser.nextToken()) != XContentParser.Token.END_OBJECT) {\n    if (token == XContentParser.Token.FIELD_NAME) {\n        currentFieldName = parser.currentName();\n    } else if (token.isValue()) {\n        if (limitField.match(currentFieldName, LoggingDeprecationHandler.INSTANCE)) {\n            if (parser.getRestApiVersion().matches(RestApiVersion.onOrAfter(RestApiVersion.V_8))\n                && \"maximum\".equals(currentFieldName) == false) {\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"invalid parameter [limit], use [maximum] instead\");\n            } else {\n                value = parser.intValue();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n### URL\n\nPaths are declared via a Route. Routes are composed of the HTTP verb and the relative path. Optionally they can declare a deprecated verb/path combination and the REST API version in which they were deprecated.\n\nFor example:\n\n```java\n   Route.builder(GET, \"_mypath/{foo}/{bar}\").deprecated(MY_DEPRECATION_MESSAGE, RestApiVersion.V_7).build(),\n```\nNote: you can safely backport this route declaration to 7.x branch.\nThe above declares that `GET _mypath/foo/bar` is deprecated in version 7. When this path is called in a version 7 server, it will emit the deprecation warning. When this path is called in a version 8 server, it will throw a 404 error unless REST API compatibility is requested. Only then will the path be honored and will also emit a warning message.\n\n\nHTTP parameters (i.e. ?user=alice) are also covered by REST API compatibility and must be at least consumed as to not cause an error. For example if you remove a parameter in version 8, you must at least read that parameter and emit a warning when version 7 compatibility is requested.\n\nFor example:\n\n```java\nif (request.getRestApiVersion() == RestApiVersion.V_7 && request.hasParam(\"limit\")) {\n    deprecationLogger.compatibleCritical(\"limit_parameter_deprecation\",\n                      \"Deprecated parameter [limit] used, replaced by [maximum and minimum]\");\n    setMax(request.param(\"limit\"));\n }\n```\n\nThe above code checks the request's compatible version and if the request has the parameter in question. In this case the deprecation warning is not automatic and requires the developer to manually log the warning. `request.param` is also required since it consumes the value as to avoid the error of unconsumed parameters.\n\n### Testing Backwards Compatibility\n\nThe primary means of testing compatibility is via the prior major version's YAML REST tests. The build system will download the latest prior version of the YAML rest tests and execute them against the current cluster version. For example if you are testing main versioned as 9.0.0 the build system will download the yaml tests in the 8.x branch and execute those against the current cluster version for 9.0.0.\n\nPrior to execution the tests will be transformed by injecting the correct headers to enable compatibility as well as other custom changes to the tests to allow the tests to pass. These customizations are configured via the build.gradle and happen just prior to test execution. Since the compatibility tests are manipulated version of the tests stored in Github (via the past major version), it is important to find the local (on disk) version for troubleshooting compatibility tests.\n\nThe tests are wired into the `check` task, so that is the easiest way to test locally prior to committing.  More specifically the task is called `yamlRestCompatTest`. These behave nearly identical to it's non-compat `yamlRestTest` task. The only variance is that the tests are sourced from the prior version branch and the tests go through a transformation phase before execution. The transformation task is `yamlRestCompatTestTransform`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n./gradlew :rest-api-spec:yamlRestCompatTest\n```\n\nSince these are a variation of backward compatibility testing, the entire suite of compatibility tests will be skipped anytime the backward compatibility testing is disabled. Since the source code for these tests live in a branch of code, disabling a specific test should be done via the transformation task configuration in build.gradle (i.e. `yamlRestCompatTestTransform`).\n\nIn some cases the prior version of the YAML REST tests are not sufficient to fully test changes. This can happen when the prior version has insufficient test coverage. In those cases, you can simply add more testing to the prior version or you can add custom REST tests that will run along side of the other compatibility tests. These custom tests can be found in the `yamlRestCompatTest` sourceset. Custom REST tests for compatibility will not be modified prior to execution, so the correct headers need to be manually added.\n\n#### Breaking Changes\n\nIt is possible to be in a state where you have intentionally made a breaking change and the compatibility tests will fail irrespective of checks for `skip` or `requires` cluster or test features in the current version such as 9.0.0. In this state, assuming the breaking changes are reasonable and agreed upon by the breaking change committee, the correct behavior is to skip the test in the `build.gradle` in 9.0.0. For example, if you make a breaking change that causes the `range/20_synthetic_source/Date range` to break then this test can be disabled temporarily in this file `rest-api-spec/build.gradle` like within this snippet:\n\n```groovy\ntasks.named(\"yamlRestCompatTestTransform\").configure({task ->\n    task.skipTest(\"range/20_synthetic_source/Date range\", \"date range breaking change causes tests to produce incorrect values for compatibility\")\n    task.skipTest(\"indices.sort/10_basic/Index Sort\", \"warning does not exist for compatibility\")\n    task.skipTest(\"search/330_fetch_fields/Test search rewrite\", \"warning does not exist for compatibility\")\n    task.skipTestsByFilePattern(\"indices.create/synthetic_source*.yml\", \"@UpdateForV9 -> tests do not pass after bumping API version to 9 [ES-9597]\")\n})\n```\n\nWhen skipping a test temporarily in 9.0.0, we have to implement the proper `skip` and `requires` conditions to previous branches, such as 8.latest. After these conditions are implemented in 8.latest, you can re-enable the test in 9.0.0 by removing the `skipTest` condition.\n\nThe team implementing the changes can decide how to clean up or modify tests based on how breaking changes were backported. e.g.:\n\nIn 8.latest:\n\n* Add `skip` / `requires` conditions to existing tests that check the old behavior. This prevents those tests from failing during backward compatibility or upgrade testing from 8.latest to 9.0.0\n\nIn 9.0.0:\n\n* Add `requires` conditions for new tests that validate the updated API or output format\n* Add `skip` conditions for older tests that would break in 9.0.0\n\n#### Test Features\n\nBoth cluster and test features exist. Cluster features are meant for new capability and test features can specifically be used to gate and manage `skip` and `requires` yaml test operations.  For more information, see [Versioning.md](docs/internal/Versioning.md#cluster-features). When backporting and using these features they can not overlap in name and must be consistent when backported so that clusters built with these features are compatible.\n\n### Developer's workflow\n\nThere should not be much, if any, deviation in a developers normal workflow to introduce and back-port changes. Changes should be applied in main, then back ported as needed.\n\nMost of the compatibility will work correctly when back-porting as-is, but some care is needed that the logic is correct for that version when back-porting.  For example, both the route (URL) and field (de-serialization) declarations with version awareness will behave differently if the declared version is the current version or the prior version. This allows the same line of code to be back ported as-is with differing behavior.  Additionally the compatible version is always populated (even when not requested, defaulting to the current version), so conditional logic comparing against a specific version is safe across branches.\n\nMixed clusters are not explicitly tested since the change should be applied at the REST (coordinating node) layer.\n\n### Troubleshooting compatibility test failures\n\nBy far the most common reason that compatibility tests can seemingly randomly fail is that your main branch is out of date with the upstream main. For this reason, it always suggested to ensure that your PR branch is up to date.\n\nTest failure reproduction lines should behave identical to the non-compatible variant. However, to assure you are referencing the correct line number when reading the test, be sure to look at the line number from the transformed test on disk.  Generally the fully transformed tests can be found at `build/restResources/compat/yamlTests/transformed/rest-api-spec/test/*`.\n\nMuting compatibility tests should be done via a test transform. A per test skip or a file match can be used to skip the tests.\n\n```groovy\n\ntasks.named(\"yamlRestCompatTestTransform\").configure({ task ->\n  task.skipTestsByFilePattern(\"**/cat*/*.yml\", \"Cat API are not supported\")\n  task.skipTest(\"bulk/10_basic/Array of objects\", \"Muted due failures. See #12345\")\n})\n\n```",

Elastic will work to fix any issues, but features in technical preview are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.\n::::\n\n\nThe Painless execute API runs a script and returns a result.\n\n## {{api-request-title}} [painless-execute-api-request]\n\n`POST /_scripts/painless/_execute`\n\n\n## {{api-description-title}} [painless-execute-api-desc]\n\nUse this API to build and test scripts, such as when defining a script for a [runtime field](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/mapping/runtime-fields.md). This API requires very few dependencies, and is especially useful if you don\u2019t have permissions to write documents on a cluster.\n\nThe API uses several *contexts*, which control how scripts are executed, what variables are available at runtime, and what the return type is.\n\nEach context requires a script, but additional parameters depend on the context you\u2019re using for that script.\n\n\n## {{api-request-body-title}} [painless-execute-api-request-body]\n\n`script`\n:   (Required, object) The Painless script to execute.\n\n### Properties of `script`\n\n  `emit`\n  :   (Required) Accepts the values from the script valuation.

The script returns a `true` or `false` response. See [boolean_field context](#painless-runtime-boolean).\n\n  `date_field`\n  :   The context for [`date` fields](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/date.md). `emit` takes a `long` value and the script returns a sorted list of dates. See [date_time context](#painless-runtime-datetime).\n\n  `double_field`\n  :   The context for `double` [numeric fields](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/number.md). The script returns a sorted list of `double` values. See [double_field context](#painless-runtime-double).\n\n  `geo_point_field`\n  :   The context for [`geo-point` fields](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/geo-point.md). `emit` takes two double parameters, the latitude and longitude values, and the script returns an object in GeoJSON format containing the coordinates for the geo point. See [geo_point_field context](#painless-runtime-geo).\n\n  `ip_field`\n  :   The context for [`ip` fields](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/ip.md). The script returns a sorted list of IP addresses. See [ip_field context](#painless-runtime-ip).\n\n  `keyword_field`\n  :   The context for [`keyword` fields](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/keyword.md). The script returns a sorted list of `string` values. See [keyword_field context](#painless-runtime-keyword).\n\n  `long_field`\n  :   The context for `long` [numeric fields](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/number.md). The script returns a sorted list of `long` values. See [long_field context](#painless-runtime-long).\n\n  `composite_field`\n  :   The context for `composite` [runtime fields](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/mapping/runtime-fields.md).

You may specify a remote index by prefixing the index with the remote cluster alias. For example, `remote1:my_index` indicates that you want to execute the painless script against the \"my_index\" index on the \"remote1\" cluster. This request will be forwarded to the \"remote1\" cluster if you have [configured a connection](docs-content://deploy-manage/remote-clusters/remote-clusters-self-managed.md) to that remote cluster.\n\n::::{note}\nWildcards are not accepted in the index expression for this endpoint. The expression `*:myindex` will return the error \"No such remote cluster\" and the expression `logs*` or `remote1:logs*` will return the error \"index not found\".\n::::\n\n\n  :::::\n\n\n`params`\n:   (`Map`, read-only) Specifies any named parameters that are passed into the script as variables.\n\n`query`\n:   (Optional, object)\n\n    ::::{note}\n    This parameter only applies when `score` is specified as the script `context`.\n    ::::\n\n\n    Use this parameter to specify a query for computing a score. Besides deciding whether or not the document matches, the [query clause](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-filter-context.md#query-context) also calculates a relevance score in the `_score` metadata field.\n\n\n\n## Test context [painless-execute-test]\n\nThe `painless_test` context runs scripts without additional parameters. The only variable that is available is `params`, which can be used to access user defined values. The result of the script is always converted to a string.\n\nBecause the default context is `painless_test`, you don\u2019t need to specify the `context` or `context_setup`.\n\n### Request [_request]\n\n```console\nPOST /_scripts/painless/_execute\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"source\": \"params.count / params.total\",\n    \"params\": {\n      \"count\": 100.0,\n      \"total\": 1000.0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response [_response]\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"result\": \"0.1\"\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Filter context [painless-execute-filter-context]\n\nThe `filter` context treats scripts as if they were run inside a `script` query. For testing purposes, a document must be provided so that it will be temporarily indexed in-memory and is accessible from the script. More precisely, the `_source`, stored fields and doc values of such a document are available to the script being tested.\n\n### Request [_request_2]\n\n```console\nPUT /my-index-000001\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"field\": {\n        \"type\": \"keyword\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```console\nPOST /_scripts/painless/_execute\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"source\": \"doc['field'].value.length() <= params.max_length\",\n    \"params\": {\n      \"max_length\": 4\n    }\n  },\n  \"context\": \"filter\",\n  \"context_setup\": {\n    \"index\": \"my-index-000001\",\n    \"document\": {\n      \"field\": \"four\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response [_response_2]\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"result\": true\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Score context [painless-execute-core-context]\n\nThe `score` context treats scripts as if they were run inside a `script_score` function in a `function_score` query.\n\n### Request [_request_3]\n\n```console\nPUT /my-index-000001\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"field\": {\n        \"type\": \"keyword\"\n      },\n      \"rank\": {\n        \"type\": \"long\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```console\nPOST /_scripts/painless/_execute\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"source\": \"doc['rank'].value / params.max_rank\",\n    \"params\": {\n      \"max_rank\": 5.0\n    }\n  },\n  \"context\": \"score\",\n  \"context_setup\": {\n    \"index\": \"my-index-000001\",\n    \"document\": {\n      \"rank\": 4\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Response [_response_3]\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"result\": 0.8\n}\n```\n\n\n\n## Field contexts [painless-execute-runtime-field-context]\n\nThe field contexts treat scripts as if they were run inside the [`runtime_mappings` section](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/mapping/define-runtime-fields-in-search-request.md) of a search query. You can use field contexts to test scripts for different field types, and then include those scripts anywhere that they\u2019re supported, such as  [runtime fields](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/use-painless-scripts-in-runtime-fields.md).\n\nChoose a field context based on the data type you want to return.\n\n### `boolean_field` [painless-runtime-boolean]\n\nUse the `boolean_field` field context when you want to return a `true` or `false` value from a script valuation. [Boolean fields](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/boolean.md) accept `true` and `false` values, but can also accept strings that are interpreted as either true or false.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have data for the top 100 science fiction books of all time. You want to write scripts that return a boolean response such as whether books exceed a certain page count, or if a book was published after a specific year.\n\nConsider that your data is structured like this:\n\n```console\nPUT /my-index-000001\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"name\": {\n        \"type\": \"keyword\"\n      },\n      \"author\": {\n        \"type\": \"keyword\"\n      },\n      \"release_date\": {\n        \"type\": \"date\"\n      },\n      \"page_count\": {\n        \"type\": \"double\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can then write a script in the `boolean_field` context that indicates whether a book was published before the year 1972:\n\n```console\nPOST /_scripts/painless/_execute\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"source\": \"\"\"\n      emit(doc['release_date'].value.year < 1972);\n    \"\"\"\n  },\n  \"context\": \"boolean_field\",\n  \"context_setup\": {\n    \"index\": \"my-index-000001\",\n    \"document\": {\n      \"name\": \"Dune\",\n      \"author\": \"Frank Herbert\",\n      \"release_date\": \"1965-06-01\",\n      \"page_count\": 604\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBecause *Dune* was published in 1965, the result returns as `true`:\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"result\" : [\n    true\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, you could write a script that determines whether the first name of an author exceeds a certain number of characters. The following script operates on the `author` field to determine whether the author\u2019s first name contains at least one character, but is less than five characters:\n\n```console\nPOST /_scripts/painless/_execute\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"source\": \"\"\"\n      int space = doc['author'].value.indexOf(' ');\n      emit(space > 0 && space < 5);\n    \"\"\"\n  },\n  \"context\": \"boolean_field\",\n  \"context_setup\": {\n    \"index\": \"my-index-000001\",\n    \"document\": {\n      \"name\": \"Dune\",\n      \"author\": \"Frank Herbert\",\n      \"release_date\": \"1965-06-01\",\n      \"page_count\": 604\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBecause `Frank` is five characters, the response returns `false` for the script valuation:\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"result\" : [\n    false\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n### `date_time` [painless-runtime-datetime]\n\nSeveral options are available for using [using datetime in Painless](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/using-datetime-in-painless.md). In this example, you\u2019ll estimate when a particular author starting writing a book based on its release date and the writing speed of that author. The example makes some assumptions, but shows to write a script that operates on a date while incorporating additional information.\n\nAdd the following fields to your index mapping to get started:\n\n```console\nPUT /my-index-000001\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"name\": {\n        \"type\": \"keyword\"\n      },\n      \"author\": {\n        \"type\": \"keyword\"\n      },\n      \"release_date\": {\n        \"type\": \"date\"\n      },\n      \"page_count\": {\n        \"type\": \"long\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe following script makes the incredible assumption that when writing a book, authors just write each page and don\u2019t do research or revisions. Further, the script assumes that the average time it takes to write a page is eight hours.\n\nThe script retrieves the `author` and makes another fantastic assumption to either divide or multiply the `pageTime` value based on the author\u2019s perceived writing speed (yet another wild assumption).\n\nThe script subtracts the release date value (in milliseconds) from the calculation of `pageTime` times the `page_count` to determine approximately (based on numerous assumptions) when the author began writing the book.\n\n```console\nPOST /_scripts/painless/_execute\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"source\": \"\"\"\n      String author = doc['author'].value;\n      long pageTime = 28800000;  <1>\n      if (author == 'Robert A. Heinlein') {\n        pageTime /= 2;           <2>\n      } else if (author == 'Alastair Reynolds') {\n        pageTime *= 2;           <3>\n      }\n      emit(doc['release_date'].value.toInstant().toEpochMilli() - pageTime * doc['page_count'].value);\n    \"\"\"\n  },\n  \"context\": \"date_field\",\n  \"context_setup\": {\n    \"index\": \"my-index-000001\",\n    \"document\": {\n      \"name\": \"Revelation Space\",\n      \"author\": \"Alastair Reynolds\",\n      \"release_date\": \"2000-03-15\",\n      \"page_count\": 585\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n1. Eight hours, represented in milliseconds\n2. Incredibly fast writing from Robert A. Heinlein\n3. Alastair Reynolds writes space operas at a much slower speed\n\n\nIn this case, the author is Alastair Reynolds. Based on a release date of `2000-03-15`, the script calculates that the author started writing `Revelation Space` on 19 February 1999. Writing a 585 page book in just over one year is pretty impressive!\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"result\" : [\n    \"1999-02-19T00:00:00.000Z\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n### `double_field` [painless-runtime-double]\n\nUse the `double_field` context for [numeric data](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/number.md) of type `double`. For example, let\u2019s say you have sensor data that includes a `voltage` field with values like 5.6. After indexing millions of documents, you discover that the sensor with model number `QVKC92Q` is under reporting its voltage by a factor of 1.7. Rather than reindex your data, you can fix it with a runtime field.\n\nYou need to multiply this value, but only for sensors that match a specific model number.\n\nAdd the following fields to your index mapping. The `voltage` field is a sub-field of the `measures` object.\n\n```console\nPUT my-index-000001\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"@timestamp\": {\n        \"type\": \"date\"\n      },\n      \"model_number\": {\n        \"type\": \"keyword\"\n      },\n      \"measures\": {\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"voltage\": {\n            \"type\": \"double\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe following script matches on any documents where the `model_number` equals `QVKC92Q`, and then multiplies the `voltage` value by `1.7`. This script is useful when you want to select specific documents and only operate on values that match the specified criteria.\n\n```console\nPOST /_scripts/painless/_execute\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"source\": \"\"\"\n      if (doc['model_number'].value.equals('QVKC92Q'))\n      {emit(1.7 * params._source['measures']['voltage']);}\n      else{emit(params._source['measures']['voltage']);}\n    \"\"\"\n  },\n  \"context\": \"double_field\",\n  \"context_setup\": {\n    \"index\": \"my-index-000001\",\n    \"document\": {\n      \"@timestamp\": 1516470094000,\n      \"model_number\": \"QVKC92Q\",\n      \"measures\": {\n        \"voltage\": 5.6\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe result includes the calculated voltage, which was determined by multiplying the original value of `5.6` by `1.7`:\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"result\" : [\n    9.52\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n### `geo_point_field` [painless-runtime-geo]\n\n[Geo-point](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/geo-point.md) fields accept latitude-longitude pairs. You can define a geo-point field in several ways, and include values for latitude and longitude in the document for your script.\n\nIf you already have a known geo-point, it\u2019s simpler to clearly state the positions of `lat` and `lon` in your index mappings.\n\n```console\nPUT /my-index-000001/\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"lat\": {\n        \"type\": \"double\"\n      },\n      \"lon\": {\n        \"type\": \"double\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can then use the `geo_point_field` runtime field context to write a script that retrieves the `lat` and `lon` values.\n\n```console\nPOST /_scripts/painless/_execute\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"source\": \"\"\"\n      emit(doc['lat'].value, doc['lon'].value);\n    \"\"\"\n  },\n  \"context\": \"geo_point_field\",\n  \"context_setup\": {\n    \"index\": \"my-index-000001\",\n    \"document\": {\n      \"lat\": 41.12,\n      \"lon\": -71.34\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBecause you\u2019re working with a geo-point field type, the response includes results that are formatted as `coordinates`.\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"result\" : [\n    {\n      \"coordinates\" : [\n        -71.34,\n        41.12\n      ],\n      \"type\" : \"Point\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n::::{note}\nThe emit function for [geo-point](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/geo-point.md) fields takes two parameters ordered with `lat` before `lon`, but the output GeoJSON format orders the `coordinates` as `[ lon, lat ]`.\n::::\n\n\n\n### `ip_field` [painless-runtime-ip]\n\nThe `ip_field` context is useful for data that includes IP addresses of type [`ip`](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/ip.md). For example, let\u2019s say you have a `message` field from an Apache log. This field contains an IP address, but also other data that you don\u2019t need.\n\nYou can add the `message` field to your index mappings as a `wildcard` to accept pretty much any data you want to put in that field.\n\n```console\nPUT /my-index-000001/\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"message\": {\n        \"type\": \"wildcard\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can then define a runtime script with a grok pattern that extracts structured fields out of the `message` field.\n\nThe script matches on the `%{{COMMONAPACHELOG}}` log pattern, which understands the structure of Apache logs. If the pattern matches, the script emits the value matching the IP address. If the pattern doesn\u2019t match (`clientip != null`), the script just returns the field value without crashing.\n\n```console\nPOST /_scripts/painless/_execute\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"source\": \"\"\"\n      String clientip=grok('%{COMMONAPACHELOG}').extract(doc[\"message\"].value)?.clientip;\n      if (clientip != null) emit(clientip);\n    \"\"\"\n  },\n  \"context\": \"ip_field\",\n  \"context_setup\": {\n    \"index\": \"my-index-000001\",\n    \"document\": {\n      \"message\": \"40.135.0.0 - - [30/Apr/2020:14:30:17 -0500] \\\"GET /images/hm_bg.jpg HTTP/1.0\\\" 200 24736\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe response includes only the IP address, ignoring all of the other data in the `message` field.\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"result\" : [\n    \"40.135.0.0\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n### `keyword_field` [painless-runtime-keyword]\n\n[Keyword fields](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/keyword.md) are often used in sorting, aggregations, and term-level queries.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a timestamp. You want to calculate the day of the week based on that value and return it, such as `Thursday`. The following request adds a `@timestamp` field of type `date` to the index mappings:\n\n```console\nPUT /my-index-000001\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"@timestamp\": {\n        \"type\": \"date\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo return the equivalent day of week based on your timestamp, you can create a script in the `keyword_field` runtime field context:\n\n```console\nPOST /_scripts/painless/_execute\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"source\": \"\"\"\n      emit(doc['@timestamp'].value.dayOfWeekEnum.getDisplayName(TextStyle.FULL, Locale.ENGLISH));\n    \"\"\"\n  },\n  \"context\": \"keyword_field\",\n  \"context_setup\": {\n    \"index\": \"my-index-000001\",\n    \"document\": {\n      \"@timestamp\": \"2020-04-30T14:31:43-05:00\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe script operates on the value provided for the `@timestamp` field to calculate and return the day of the week:\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"result\" : [\n    \"Thursday\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n### `long_field` [painless-runtime-long]\n\nLet\u2019s say you have sensor data that a `measures` object. This object includes a `start` and `end` field, and you want to calculate the difference between those values.\n\nThe following request adds a `measures` object to the mappings with two fields, both of type `long`:\n\n```console\nPUT /my-index-000001/\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"measures\": {\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"start\": {\n            \"type\": \"long\"\n          },\n          \"end\": {\n           \"type\": \"long\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can then define a script that assigns values to the `start` and `end` fields and operate on them. The following script extracts the value for the `end` field from the `measures` object and subtracts it from the `start` field:\n\n```console\nPOST /_scripts/painless/_execute\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"source\": \"\"\"\n      emit(doc['measures.end'].value - doc['measures.start'].value);\n    \"\"\"\n  },\n  \"context\": \"long_field\",\n  \"context_setup\": {\n    \"index\": \"my-index-000001\",\n    \"document\": {\n      \"measures\": {\n        \"voltage\": \"4.0\",\n        \"start\": \"400\",\n        \"end\": \"8625309\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe response includes the calculated value from the script valuation:\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"result\" : [\n    8624909\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n### `composite_field` [painless-runtime-composite]\n\nLet\u2019s say you have logging data with a raw `message` field which you want to split in multiple sub-fields that can be accessed separately.\n\nThe following request adds a `message` field to the mappings of type `keyword`:\n\n```console\nPUT /my-index-000001/\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"message\": {\n        \"type\" : \"keyword\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can then define a script that splits such message field into subfields using the grok function:\n\n```console\nPOST /_scripts/painless/_execute\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"source\": \"emit(grok(\\\"%{COMMONAPACHELOG}\\\").extract(doc[\\\"message\\\"].value));\"\n  },\n  \"context\": \"composite_field\",\n  \"context_setup\": {\n    \"index\": \"my-index-000001\",\n    \"document\": {\n      \"timestamp\":\"2020-04-30T14:31:27-05:00\",\n      \"message\":\"252.0.0.0 - - [30/Apr/2020:14:31:27 -0500] \\\"GET /images/hm_bg.jpg HTTP/1.0\\\" 200 24736\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe response includes the values that the script emitted:\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"result\" : {\n    \"composite_field.timestamp\" : [\n      \"30/Apr/2020:14:31:27 -0500\"\n    ],\n    \"composite_field.auth\" : [\n      \"-\"\n    ],\n    \"composite_field.response\" : [\n      \"200\"\n    ],\n    \"composite_field.ident\" : [\n      \"-\"\n    ],\n    \"composite_field.httpversion\" : [\n      \"1.0\"\n    ],\n    \"composite_field.verb\" : [\n      \"GET\"\n    ],\n    \"composite_field.bytes\" : [\n      \"24736\"\n    ],\n    \"composite_field.clientip\" : [\n      \"252.0.0.0\"\n    ],\n    \"composite_field.request\" : [\n      \"/images/hm_bg.jpg\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",

          "content": "When upgrading Elasticsearch to a new major version, REST API compatibility is crucial for ensuring that clients continue to function smoothly despite potential breaking changes. Below is a detailed description of how REST API compatibility works during these upgrades:\n\n### How REST API Compatibility Works\n\n1. **Opt-in API Compatibility Mode**: Elasticsearch allows clients to enable compatibility mode per request. When a breaking change is introduced, clients can use this mode to ensure that their requests are processed using the logic of the previous version of the API. This is particularly useful when an API has been deprecated and later removed.\n\n2. **General Stability**: Although Elasticsearch REST APIs are designed to be stable across versions, some enhancements might require non-compatible changes. This necessitates the introduction of compatibility modes.\n\n3. **Handling of Deprecated APIs**:\n   - When an API is set for removal or change, it is first marked as deprecated. Clients that use deprecated APIs will receive warnings in their logs, helping them prepare and modify their implementation before the actual upgrade.\n   - The deprecated features should typically be replaced in the current version before proceeding to the next major version.\n\n4. **Using Compatibility Headers**: \n   - REST API compatibility can be enabled using the `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers. For example:\n     ```http\n     Accept: \"application/vnd.elasticsearch+json;compatible-with=8\"\n     Content-Type: \"application/vnd.elasticsearch+json;compatible-with=8\"\n     ```\n   - The `Accept` header is mandatory, while the `Content-Type` header is needed if the request has a body.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Even in compatibility mode, there are cases where Elasticsearch might not be able to resolve incompatibilities and could still return errors. If a request is compatible, it will attempt to process it without issues; if it isn\u2019t, an error message is returned, allowing the user to identify the problem.\n\n6. **Deprecation Logs**: When using compatibility mode, any adjustments made by Elasticsearch to resolve incompatibilities will be logged with a category \"compatible_api\". It's important for users to review these logs to ensure that they address any issues before completely migrating to the new version.\n\n7. **Bridge to Upgrades**: The REST API compatibility feature acts as a temporary measure to facilitate smoother transitions between major version upgrades, rather than a long-term solution.\n\n8. **Compatibility Constraints**: \n   - Compatibility is only maintained across one major version \u2014 for instance, a client using version 8 APIs can be compatible with version 9, but not with version 7 when connected to version 8.\n   - The feature allows clients to remain on an older version while connecting to a newer server version.\n\n### Recommended Upgrade Workflow\nHere\u2019s the advised workflow for leveraging REST API compatibility during upgrades:\n1. Update your clients to the latest version of the previous major version (e.g., from 8.x to the last 8.x version).\n2. Enable REST API compatibility for these requests.\n3. Use the Upgrade Assistant to identify and resolve critical issues.\n4. Conduct the upgrade to the new major version.\n5. Once upgraded, check the deprecation logs for entries related to compatibility and address them as necessary.\n6. Finally, update your clients to the new major version and manage any remaining compatibility concerns.\n\n### References\n- For detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation: [REST API Compatibility](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rest-api-compatibility.html) and [REST API Compatibility Developers Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rest-api-compatibility-developers-guide.html). \n\nThese principles ensure that users have a clear pathway and tools to manage the evolution of APIs across major upgrades in Elasticsearch.",
