Each document within an index is a JSON object that contains fields and values, similar to rows in a table.\n\nIndexes are used to organize and manage data in Elasticsearch, allowing for fast retrieval and efficient storage. Each index is identified by a unique name, which is used when performing operations like searching, indexing, and updating documents.\n\nHere are some key points about indexes in Elasticsearch:\n\n- An index can contain many documents, but each document can only belong to one index.\n- Indexes can be configured with different settings and mappings to define how fields are indexed and stored.\n- You can perform full-text searches, aggregations, and other complex queries on the documents within an index.\n\nFor more detailed and technical information, refer to the Elasticsearch documentation.",
