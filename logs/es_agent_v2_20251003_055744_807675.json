              "content": "# Operators: General [painless-operators-general]\n\n## Precedence [precedence-operator]\n\nUse the `precedence operator '()'` to guarantee the order of evaluation for an expression. An expression encapsulated by the precedence operator (enclosed in parentheses) overrides existing precedence relationships between operators and is evaluated prior to other expressions in inward-to-outward order.\n\n**Grammar**\n\n```text\nprecedence: '(' expression ')';\n```\n\n**Examples**\n\n* Precedence with numeric operators.\n\n    ```painless\n    int x = (5+4)*6;   <1>\n    int y = 12/(x-50); <2>\n    ```\n\n    1. declare `int x`; add `int 5` and `int 4` \u2192 `int 9`; multiply `int 9` and `int 6` \u2192 `int 54`; store `int 54` to `x`; (note the add is evaluated before the multiply due to the precedence operator)\n    2. declare `int y`; load from `x` \u2192 `int 54`; subtract `int 50` from `int 54` \u2192 `int 4`; divide `int 12` by `int 4` \u2192 `int 3`; store `int 3` to `y`; (note the subtract is evaluated before the divide due to the precedence operator)\n\n\n\n## Function Call [function-call-operator]\n\nUse the `function call operator ()` to call an existing function. A [function call](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless-functions.md) is defined within a script.\n\n**Grammar**\n\n```text\nfunction_call: ID '(' ( expression (',' expression)* )? ')'';\n```\n\n**Examples**\n\n* A function call.\n\n    ```painless\n    int add(int x, int y) { <1>\n          return x + y;\n      }\n\n    int z = add(1, 2); <2>\n    ```\n\n    1. define function `add` that returns `int` and has parameters (`int x`, `int y`)\n    2. declare `int z`; call `add` with arguments (`int 1`, `int 2`) \u2192 `int 3`; store `int 3` to `z`\n\n\n\n## Cast [cast-operator]\n\nAn explicit cast converts the value of an original type to the equivalent value of a target type forcefully as an operation. Use the `cast operator '()'` to specify an explicit cast. Refer to [casting](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless-casting.md) for more information.\n\n\n## Conditional [conditional-operator]\n\nA conditional consists of three expressions. The first expression is evaluated with an expected boolean result type. If the first expression evaluates to true then the second expression will be evaluated. If the first expression evaluates to false then the third expression will be evaluated. The second and third expressions will be [promoted](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless-casting.md#promotion) if the evaluated values are not the same type. Use the `conditional operator '? :'` as a shortcut to avoid the need for a full if/else branch in certain expressions.\n\n**Errors**\n\n* If the first expression does not evaluate to a boolean type value.\n* If the values for the second and third expressions cannot be promoted.\n\n**Grammar**\n\n```text\nconditional: expression '?' expression ':' expression;\n```\n\n**Promotion**\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | byte | short | char | int | long | float | double | Reference | def |\n| byte | int | int | int | int | long | float | double | - | def |\n| short | int | int | int | int | long | float | double | - | def |\n| char | int | int | int | int | long | float | double | - | def |\n| int | int | int | int | int | long | float | double | - | def |\n| long | long | long | long | long | long | float | double | - | def |\n| float | float | float | float | float | float | float | double | - | def |\n| double | double | double | double | double | double | double | double | - | def |\n| Reference | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | Object @ | def |\n| def | def | def | def | def | def | def | def | def | def |\n\n@ If the two reference type values are the same then this promotion will not occur.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* Evaluation of conditionals.\n\n    ```painless\n    boolean b = true;        <1>\n    int x = b ? 1 : 2;       <2>\n    List y = x > 1 ? new ArrayList() : null; <3>\n    def z = x < 2 ? x : 2.0; <4>\n    ```\n\n    1. declare `boolean b`; store `boolean true` to `b`\n    2. declare `int x`; load from `b` \u2192 `boolean true` evaluate 1st expression: `int 1` \u2192 `int 1`; store `int 1` to `x`\n    3. declare `List y`; load from `x` \u2192 `int 1`; `int 1` greater than `int 1` \u2192 `boolean false`; evaluate 2nd expression: `null` \u2192 `null`; store `null` to `y`;\n    4. declare `def z`; load from `x` \u2192 `int 1`; `int 1` less than `int 2` \u2192 `boolean true`; evaluate 1st expression: load from `x` \u2192 `int 1`; promote `int 1` and `double 2.0`: result `double`; implicit cast `int 1` to `double 1.0` \u2192 `double 1.0`; implicit cast `double 1.0` to `def` \u2192 `def`; store `def` to `z`;\n\n\n\n## Assignment [assignment-operator]\n\nUse the `assignment operator '='` to store a value in a variable or reference type member field for use in subsequent operations. Any operation that produces a value can be assigned to any variable/field as long as the [types](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless-types.md) are the same or the resultant type can be [implicitly cast](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless-casting.md) to the variable/field type.\n\nSee [variable assignment](/reference/scripting-languages/painless/painless-variables.md#variable-assignment) for examples using variables.\n\n**Errors**\n\n* If the type of value is unable to match the type of variable or field.\n\n**Grammar**\n\n```text\nassignment: field '=' expression\n```\n\n**Examples**\n\nThe examples use the following reference type definition:\n\n```painless\nname:\n  Example\n\nnon-static member fields:\n  * int x\n  * def y\n  * List z\n```\n\n* Field assignments of different type values.\n\n    ```painless\n    Example example = new Example(); <1>\n    example.x = 1;                   <2>\n    example.y = 2.0;                 <3>\n    example.z = new ArrayList();     <4>\n    ```\n\n    1. declare `Example example`; allocate `Example` instance \u2192 `Example reference`; store `Example reference` to `example`\n    2. load from `example` \u2192 `Example reference`; store `int 1` to `x` of `Example reference`\n    3. load from `example` \u2192 `Example reference`; implicit cast `double 2.0` to `def` \u2192 `def`; store `def` to `y` of `Example reference`\n    4. load from `example` \u2192 `Example reference`; allocate `ArrayList` instance \u2192 `ArrayList reference`; implicit cast `ArrayList reference` to `List reference` \u2192 `List reference`; store `List reference` to `z` of `Example reference`\n\n* A field assignment from a field access.\n\n    ```painless\n    Example example = new Example(); <1>\n    example.x = 1;                   <2>\n    example.y = example.x;           <3>\n    ```\n\n    1. declare `Example example`; allocate `Example` instance \u2192 `Example reference`; store `Example reference` to `example`\n    2. load from `example` \u2192 `Example reference`; store `int 1` to `x` of `Example reference`\n    3. load from `example` \u2192 `Example reference @0`; load from `example` \u2192 `Example reference @1`; load from `x` of `Example reference @1` \u2192 `int 1`; implicit cast `int 1` to `def` \u2192 `def`; store `def` to `y` of `Example reference @0`; (note `Example reference @0` and `Example reference @1` are the same)\n\n\n\n## Compound Assignment [compound-assignment-operator]\n\nUse the `compound assignment operator '$='` as a shortcut for an assignment where a binary operation would occur between the variable/field as the left-hand side expression and a separate right-hand side expression.\n\nA compound assignment is equivalent to the expression below where V is the variable/field and T is the type of variable/member.\n\n```painless\nV = (T)(V op expression);\n```\n\n**Operators**\n\nThe table below shows the available operators for use in a compound assignment. Each operator follows the casting/promotion rules according to their regular definition. For numeric operations there is an extra implicit cast when necessary to return the promoted numeric type value to the original numeric type value of the variable/field and can result in data loss.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Operator | Compound Symbol |\n| Multiplication | *= |\n| Division | /= |\n| Remainder | %= |\n| Addition | += |\n| Subtraction | -= |\n| Left Shift | <<= |\n| Right Shift | >>= |\n| Unsigned Right Shift | >>>= |\n| Bitwise And | &= |\n| Boolean And | &= |\n| Bitwise Xor | ^= |\n| Boolean Xor | ^= |\n| Bitwise Or | &#124;= |\n| Boolean Or | &#124;= |\n| String Concatenation | += |\n\n**Errors**\n\n* If the type of value is unable to match the type of variable or field.\n\n**Grammar**\n\n```text\ncompound_assignment: ( ID | field ) '$=' expression;\n```\n\nNote the use of the `$=` represents the use of any of the possible binary operators.\n\n**Examples**\n\n* Compound assignment for each numeric operator.\n\n    ```painless\n    int i = 10; <1>\n    i *= 2;     <2>\n    i /= 5;     <3>\n    i %= 3;     <4>\n    i += 5;     <5>\n    i -= 5;     <6>\n    i <<= 2;    <7>\n    i >>= 1;    <8>\n    i >>>= 1;   <9>\n    i &= 15;    <10>\n    i ^= 12;

divide `int 20` by `int 5` \u2192 `int 4`; store `int 4` to `i`; (note this is equivalent to `i = i/5`)\n    4. load from `i` \u2192 `int 4`; remainder `int 4` by `int 3` \u2192 `int 1`; store `int 1` to `i`;

subtract `int 5` from `int 6` \u2192 `int 1`; store `int 1` to `i`; (note this is equivalent to `i = i-5`)\n    7. load from `i` \u2192 `int 1`; left shift `int 1` by `int 2` \u2192 `int 4`; store `int 4` to `i`; (note this is equivalent to `i = i<<2`)\n    8. load from `i` \u2192 `int 4`; right shift `int 4` by `int 1` \u2192 `int 2`; store `int 2` to `i`; (note this is equivalent to `i = i>>1`)\n    9. load from `i` \u2192 `int 2`;

This is particularly useful for GIS applications where circles need to be represented accurately in different geometrical formats.\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Input Formats**: It accepts circles defined in both Well-Known Text (WKT) format and GeoJSON format.\n- **Output**: The processor generates a polygon that closely approximates the input circle.\n- **Configuration Options**:\n  - `field`: The input field containing the circle definition that needs to be processed (mandatory).\n  - `target_field`: The output field where the polygon will be stored (optional).\n  - `ignore_missing`: If set to true, the processor will not fail if the specified field does not exist (optional).\n  - `error_distance`: Defines how accurately the polygon should resemble the circle, specified in meters for `geo_shape` types.\n  - `shape_type`: Indicates whether to process the circle as a `geo_shape` or `shape`.\n  - Additional options are available for error handling and debugging.\n\n### Examples:\n1. **Using WKT Format**:\n   - You can index a circle defined in WKT as follows:\n     ```json\n     PUT circles/_doc/1?pipeline=polygonize_circles\n     {\n       \"circle\": \"CIRCLE (30 10 40)\"\n     }\n     ```\n   - The resulting polygon is then saved and can be retrieved.\n\n2. **Using GeoJSON Format**:\n   - A GeoJSON representation can also be indexed:\n     ```json\n     PUT circles/_doc/2?pipeline=polygonize_circles\n     {\n       \"circle\": {\n         \"type\": \"circle\",\n         \"radius\": \"40m\",\n         \"coordinates\": [30, 10]\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n   - This too would return a polygon representation of the circle.\n\nThe ingest-circle-processor is particularly useful in applications such as mapping and geospatial analysis, where precision in representing circular areas is important.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation here: [Circle processor](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/docs/reference/enrich-processor/ingest-circle-processor.md).",
