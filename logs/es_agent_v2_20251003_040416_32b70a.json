Effectively this aggregation can break out of the nested block structure and link to other nested structures or the root document, which allows nesting other aggregations that aren\u2019t part of the nested object in a nested aggregation.\n\nThe `reverse_nested` aggregation must be defined inside a `nested` aggregation.\n\n* `path` - Which defines to what nested object field should be joined back. The default is empty, which means that it joins back to the root / main document level. The path cannot contain a reference to a nested object field that falls outside the `nested` aggregation\u2019s nested structure a `reverse_nested` is in.\n\nFor example, lets say we have an index for a ticket system with issues and comments. The comments are inlined into the issue documents as nested documents. The mapping could look like:\n\n$$$reversed-nested-aggregation-example$$$\n\n```console\nPUT /issues\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"tags\": { \"type\": \"keyword\" },\n      \"comments\": {                            <1>\n        \"type\": \"nested\",\n        \"properties\": {\n          \"username\": { \"type\": \"keyword\" },\n          \"comment\": { \"type\": \"text\" }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n1. The `comments` is an array that holds nested documents under the `issue` object.\n\n\nThe following aggregations will return the top commenters' username that have commented and per top commenter the top tags of the issues the user has commented on:\n\n```console\nGET /issues/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match_all\": {}\n  },\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"comments\": {\n      \"nested\": {\n        \"path\": \"comments\"\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"top_usernames\": {\n          \"terms\": {\n            \"field\": \"comments.username\"\n          },\n          \"aggs\": {\n            \"comment_to_issue\": {\n              \"reverse_nested\": {}, <1>\n              \"aggs\": {\n                \"top_tags_per_comment\": {\n                  \"terms\": {\n                    \"field\": \"tags\"\n                  }\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see above, the `reverse_nested` aggregation is put in to a `nested` aggregation as this is the only place in the dsl where the `reverse_nested` aggregation can be used. Its sole purpose is to join back to a parent doc higher up in the nested structure.\n\n1. A `reverse_nested` aggregation that joins back to the root / main document level, because no `path` has been defined. Via the `path` option the `reverse_nested` aggregation can join back to a different level, if multiple layered nested object types have been defined in the mapping\n\n\nPossible response snippet:\n\n```console-result\n{\n  \"aggregations\": {\n    \"comments\": {\n      \"doc_count\": 1,\n      \"top_usernames\": {\n        \"doc_count_error_upper_bound\" : 0,\n        \"sum_other_doc_count\" : 0,\n        \"buckets\": [\n          {\n            \"key\": \"username_1\",\n            \"doc_count\": 1,\n            \"comment_to_issue\": {\n              \"doc_count\": 1,\n              \"top_tags_per_comment\": {\n                \"doc_count_error_upper_bound\" : 0,\n                \"sum_other_doc_count\" : 0,\n                \"buckets\": [\n                  {\n                    \"key\": \"tag_1\",\n                    \"doc_count\": 1\n                  }\n                  ...\n                ]\n              }\n            }\n          }\n          ...\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

An `aggregate_metric_double` field is an object containing one or more of the following metric sub-fields: `min`, `max`, `sum`, and `value_count`.\n\nWhen you run certain metric aggregations on an `aggregate_metric_double` field, the aggregation uses the related sub-field\u2019s values. For example, a [`min`](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-metrics-min-aggregation.md) aggregation on an `aggregate_metric_double` field returns the minimum value of all `min` sub-fields.\n\n::::{important}\nAn `aggregate_metric_double` field stores a single numeric [doc value](/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/doc-values.md) for each metric sub-field.

Must be a value from the `metrics` array.\n\n`time_series_metric`\n:   (Optional, string) Marks the field as a [time series metric](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/data-streams/time-series-data-stream-tsds.md#time-series-metric). The value is the metric type. You can\u2019t update this parameter for existing fields.\n\n    **Valid `time_series_metric` values for `aggregate_metric_double` fields**:\n\n    `gauge`\n    :   A metric that represents a single numeric that can arbitrarily increase or decrease. For example, a temperature or available disk space.\n\n    `null` (Default)\n    :   Not a time series metric.\n\n\n## Uses [aggregate-metric-double-uses]\n\nWe designed `aggregate_metric_double` fields for use with the following aggregations:\n\n* A [`min`](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-metrics-min-aggregation.md) aggregation returns the minimum value of all `min` sub-fields.\n* A [`max`](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-metrics-max-aggregation.md) aggregation returns the maximum value of all `max` sub-fields.\n* A [`sum`](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-metrics-sum-aggregation.md) aggregation returns the sum of the values of all `sum` sub-fields.\n* A [`value_count`](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-metrics-valuecount-aggregation.md) aggregation returns the sum of the values of all `value_count` sub-fields.\n* A [`avg`](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-metrics-avg-aggregation.md) aggregation. There is no `avg` sub-field; the result of the `avg` aggregation is computed using the `sum` and `value_count` metrics. To run an `avg` aggregation, the field must contain both `sum` and `value_count` metric sub-field.\n\nRunning any other aggregation on an `aggregate_metric_double` field will fail with an \"unsupported aggregation\" error.\n\nFinally, an `aggregate_metric_double` field supports the following queries for which it behaves as a `double` by delegating its behavior to its `default_metric` sub-field:\n\n* [`exists`](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-exists-query.md)\n* [`range`](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-range-query.md)\n* [`term`](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-term-query.md)\n* [`terms`](/reference/query-languages/query-dsl/query-dsl-terms-query.md)\n\n\n## Examples [aggregate-metric-double-example]\n\nThe following [create index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-create) API request creates an index with an `aggregate_metric_double` field named `agg_metric`.

For example, you can chain together two derivatives to calculate the second derivative (i.e. a derivative of a derivative).\n\n::::{note}\nBecause pipeline aggregations only add to the output, when chaining pipeline aggregations the output of each pipeline aggregation will be included in the final output.\n::::\n\n\n\n## `buckets_path` Syntax [buckets-path-syntax]\n\nMost pipeline aggregations require another aggregation as their input. The input aggregation is defined via the `buckets_path` parameter, which follows a specific format:\n\n```ebnf\nAGG_SEPARATOR       =  `>` ;\nMETRIC_SEPARATOR    =  `.` ;\nAGG_NAME            =  <the name of the aggregation> ;\nMETRIC              =  <the name of the metric (in case of multi-value metrics aggregation)> ;\nMULTIBUCKET_KEY     =  `[<KEY_NAME>]`\nPATH                =  <AGG_NAME><MULTIBUCKET_KEY>? (<AGG_SEPARATOR>, <AGG_NAME> )* ( <METRIC_SEPARATOR>, <METRIC> ) ;\n```\n\nFor example, the path `\"my_bucket>my_stats.avg\"` will path to the `avg` value in the `\"my_stats\"` metric, which is contained in the `\"my_bucket\"` bucket aggregation.\n\nHere are some more examples:\n\n* `multi_bucket[\"foo\"]>single_bucket>multi_metric.avg` will go to the `avg` metric in the `\"multi_metric\"` agg under the single bucket `\"single_bucket\"` within the `\"foo\"` bucket of the `\"multi_bucket\"` multi-bucket aggregation.\n* `agg1[\"foo\"]._count` will get the `_count` metric for the `\"foo\"` bucket in the multi-bucket aggregation `\"multi_bucket\"`\n\nPaths are relative from the position of the pipeline aggregation; they are not absolute paths, and the path cannot go back \"up\" the aggregation tree. For example, this derivative is embedded inside a date_histogram and refers to a \"sibling\" metric `\"the_sum\"`:\n\n$$$buckets-path-example$$$\n\n```console\nPOST /_search\n{\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"my_date_histo\": {\n      \"date_histogram\": {\n        \"field\": \"timestamp\",\n        \"calendar_interval\": \"day\"\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"the_sum\": {\n          \"sum\": { \"field\": \"lemmings\" }              <1>\n        },\n        \"the_deriv\": {\n          \"derivative\": { \"buckets_path\": \"the_sum\" } <2>\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n1. The metric is called `\"the_sum\"`\n2. The `buckets_path` refers to the metric via a relative path `\"the_sum\"`\n\n\n`buckets_path` is also used for Sibling pipeline aggregations, where the aggregation is \"next\" to a series of buckets instead of embedded \"inside\" them. For example, the `max_bucket` aggregation uses the `buckets_path` to specify a metric embedded inside a sibling aggregation:\n\n$$$buckets-path-sibling-example$$$\n\n```console\nPOST /_search\n{\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"sales_per_month\": {\n      \"date_histogram\": {\n        \"field\": \"date\",\n        \"calendar_interval\": \"month\"\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"sales\": {\n          \"sum\": {\n            \"field\": \"price\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"max_monthly_sales\": {\n      \"max_bucket\": {\n        \"buckets_path\": \"sales_per_month>sales\" <1>\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n1. `buckets_path` instructs this max_bucket aggregation that we want the maximum value of the `sales` aggregation in the `sales_per_month` date histogram.\n\n\nIf a Sibling pipeline agg references a multi-bucket aggregation, such as a `terms` agg, it also has the option to select specific keys from the multi-bucket. For example, a `bucket_script` could select two specific buckets (via their bucket keys) to perform the calculation:\n\n$$$buckets-path-specific-bucket-example$$$\n\n```console\nPOST /_search\n{\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"sales_per_month\": {\n      \"date_histogram\": {\n        \"field\": \"date\",\n        \"calendar_interval\": \"month\"\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"sale_type\": {\n          \"terms\": {\n            \"field\": \"type\"\n          },\n          \"aggs\": {\n            \"sales\": {\n              \"sum\": {\n                \"field\": \"price\"\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        },\n        \"hat_vs_bag_ratio\": {\n          \"bucket_script\": {\n            \"buckets_path\": {\n              \"hats\": \"sale_type['hat']>sales\",   <1>\n              \"bags\": \"sale_type['bag']>sales\"    <1>\n            },\n            \"script\": \"params.hats / params.bags\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n1. `buckets_path` selects the hats and bags buckets (via `['hat']`/`['bag']``) to use in the script specifically, instead of fetching all the buckets from `sale_type` aggregation\n\n\n\n## Special Paths [_special_paths]\n\nInstead of pathing to a metric, `buckets_path` can use a special `\"_count\"` path. This instructs the pipeline aggregation to use the document count as its input. For example, a derivative can be calculated on the document count of each bucket, instead of a specific metric:\n\n$$$buckets-path-count-example$$$\n\n```console\nPOST /_search\n{\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"my_date_histo\": {\n      \"date_histogram\": {\n        \"field\": \"timestamp\",\n        \"calendar_interval\": \"day\"\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"the_deriv\": {\n          \"derivative\": { \"buckets_path\": \"_count\" } <1>\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n1. By using `_count` instead of a metric name, we can calculate the derivative of document counts in the histogram\n\n\nThe `buckets_path` can also use `\"_bucket_count\"` and path to a multi-bucket aggregation to use the number of buckets returned by that aggregation in the pipeline aggregation instead of a metric. For example, a `bucket_selector` can be used here to filter out buckets which contain no buckets for an inner terms aggregation:\n\n$$$buckets-path-bucket-count-example$$$\n\n```console\nPOST /sales/_search\n{\n  \"size\": 0,\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"histo\": {\n      \"date_histogram\": {\n        \"field\": \"date\",\n        \"calendar_interval\": \"day\"\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"categories\": {\n          \"terms\": {\n            \"field\": \"category\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"min_bucket_selector\": {\n          \"bucket_selector\": {\n            \"buckets_path\": {\n              \"count\": \"categories._bucket_count\" <1>\n            },\n            \"script\": {\n              \"source\": \"params.count != 0\"\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n1. By using `_bucket_count` instead of a metric name, we can filter out `histo` buckets where they contain no buckets for the `categories` aggregation\n\n\n\n## Dealing with dots in agg names [dots-in-agg-names]\n\nAn alternate syntax is supported to cope with aggregations or metrics which have dots in the name, such as the `99.9`th [percentile](/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-metrics-percentile-aggregation.md). This metric may be referred to as:\n\n```js\n\"buckets_path\": \"my_percentile[99.9]\"\n```\n\n\n## Dealing with gaps in the data [gap-policy]\n\nData in the real world is often noisy and sometimes contains **gaps** \u2014 places where data simply doesn\u2019t exist. This can occur for a variety of reasons, the most common being:\n\n* Documents falling into a bucket do not contain a required field\n* There are no documents matching the query for one or more buckets\n* The metric being calculated is unable to generate a value, likely because another dependent bucket is missing a value. Some pipeline aggregations have specific requirements that must be met (e.g. a derivative cannot calculate a metric for the first value because there is no previous value, HoltWinters moving average need \"warmup\" data to begin calculating, etc)\n\nGap policies are a mechanism to inform the pipeline aggregation about the desired behavior when \"gappy\" or missing data is encountered. All pipeline aggregations accept the `gap_policy` parameter. There are currently two gap policies to choose from:\n\n*skip*\n:   This option treats missing data as if the bucket does not exist. It will skip the bucket and continue calculating using the next available value.\n\n*insert_zeros*\n:   This option will replace missing values with a zero (`0`) and pipeline aggregation computation will proceed as normal.\n\n*keep_values*\n:   This option is similar to skip, except if the metric provides a non-null, non-NaN value this value is used, otherwise the empty bucket is skipped.",

          "content": "Elasticsearch handles nested aggregations using the `nested` aggregation type, which allows you to aggregate on fields that contain nested documents. When using the `breadth_first` approach, it processes the documents in a way that prioritizes breadth over depth, which can impact how scores are handled during aggregation.\n\n### Key Points about Nested Aggregations with `breadth_first`:\n\n1. **Nested Aggregation**: A nested aggregation is a specialized single bucket aggregation that aggregates nested documents. It requires defining the path to the nested documents to perform any aggregation on them. \n\n2. **Score Information**: When you perform a nested aggregation, Elasticsearch may allow score information to be considered, especially if you are using it in conjunction with other scoring query constructs. However, the `nested` aggregation itself does not yield scores directly but will consider documents' scores when aggregating.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Approach**: The `breadth_first` strategy runs faster for aggregations that need to consider more documents at once, as it avoids deep recursion into document trees. This approach can make it easier to aggregate across large datasets, but it\u2019s important to note that it might not utilize score information in the same way as a depth-first approach. Scores are generally more relevant when the aggregations are being used in conjunction with scoring queries, but for purely aggregative queries, `breadth_first` focuses on efficiency.\n\n4. **Use Cases**: If you need to aggregate nested fields and also make decisions based on their score (e.g., using a `filter` or using sub-aggregations that consider scores), you need to structure your query appropriately, taking advantage of filter and score aggregations in tandem with nested aggregations.\n\n### Example of a Nested Aggregation:\n\nHere's a brief example of a nested aggregation in Elasticsearch:\n\n```json\nGET /products/_search\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"match\": {\n      \"name\": \"led tv\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"resellers\": {\n      \"nested\": {\n        \"path\": \"resellers\"\n      },\n      \"aggs\": {\n        \"min_price\": {\n          \"min\": {\n            \"field\": \"resellers.price\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the `min_price` aggregation retrieves the minimum price from the nested `resellers` documents. The score relates to the query on the top-level documents.\n\nFor more details on nested aggregations, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-nested-aggregation.html) from the Elasticsearch repository.\n\nYou\u2019ll find the relevant sections in:\n- [Nested Aggregation Documentation](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/docs/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-nested-aggregation.md)\n- [Reverse Nested Aggregation Documentation](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/docs/reference/aggregations/search-aggregations-bucket-reverse-nested-aggregation.md)\n\nIf you need further specifics or examples, let me know!",
