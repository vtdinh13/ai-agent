Changing a specific thread pool can be done by setting its type-specific parameters; for example, changing the number of threads in the `write` thread pool:\n\n```yaml\nthread_pool:\n    write:\n        size: 30\n```\n\n## Thread pool types [thread-pool-types]\n\nThe following are the types of thread pools and their respective parameters:\n\n### `fixed` [fixed-thread-pool]\n\nA `fixed` thread pool holds a fixed number of threads as determined by the `size` parameter. If a task is submitted to a `fixed` thread pool and there are fewer than `size` busy threads in the pool then the task will execute immediately. If all the threads are busy when a task is submitted then it will be held in a queue for later execution. The `queue_size` parameter controls the maximum size of this queue. A `queue_size` of `-1` means that the queue is unbounded, but most `fixed` thread pools specify a bound on their queue size by default. If a bounded queue is full then it will reject further work, which typically causes the corresponding requests to fail.\n\n```yaml\nthread_pool:\n    write:\n        size: 30\n        queue_size: 1000\n```\n\n\n### `scaling` [scaling-thread-pool]\n\nThe `scaling` thread pool holds a dynamic number of threads. This number is proportional to the workload and varies between the value of the `core` and `max` parameters.\n\nThe `keep_alive` parameter determines how long a thread should be kept around in the thread pool without it doing any work.\n\nIf a task is submitted to a `scaling` thread pool when its maximum number of threads are already busy with other tasks, the new task will be held in a queue for later execution. The queue in a `scaling` thread pool is always unbounded.\n\n```yaml\nthread_pool:\n    warmer:\n        core: 1\n        max: 8\n        keep_alive: 2m\n```\n\n\n\n## Allocated processors setting [node.processors]\n\nThe number of processors is automatically detected, and the thread pool settings are automatically set based on it. In some cases it can be useful to override the number of detected processors. This can be done by explicitly setting the `node.processors` setting. This setting is bounded by the number of available processors and accepts floating point numbers, which can be useful in environments where the {{es}} nodes are configured to run with CPU limits, such as cpu shares or quota under `Cgroups`.\n\n```yaml\nnode.processors: 2\n```\n\nThere are a few use-cases for explicitly overriding the `node.processors` setting:\n\n1. If you are running multiple instances of {{es}} on the same host but want {{es}} to size its thread pools as if it only has a fraction of the CPU, you should override the `node.processors` setting to the desired fraction, for example, if you\u2019re running two instances of {{es}} on a 16-core machine, set `node.processors` to 8. Note that this is an expert-level use case and there\u2019s a lot more involved than just setting the `node.processors` setting as there are other considerations like changing the number of garbage collector threads, pinning processes to cores, and so on.\n2. Sometimes the number of processors is wrongly detected and in such cases explicitly setting the `node.processors` setting will workaround such issues.\n\nIn order to check the number of processors detected, use the nodes info API with the `os` flag.",

The `precision_threshold` options allows to trade memory for accuracy, and defines a unique count below which counts are expected to be close to accurate. Above this value, counts might become a bit more fuzzy. The maximum supported value is 40000, thresholds above this number will have the same effect as a threshold of 40000. The default value is `3000`.\n\n\n\n## Counts are approximate [_counts_are_approximate]\n\nComputing exact counts requires loading values into a hash set and returning its size. This doesn\u2019t scale when working on high-cardinality sets and/or large values as the required memory usage and the need to communicate those per-shard sets between nodes would utilize too many resources of the cluster.\n\nThis `cardinality` aggregation is based on the [HyperLogLog++](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/fr//pubs/archive/40671.pdf) algorithm, which counts based on the hashes of the values with some interesting properties:\n\n* configurable precision, which decides on how to trade memory for accuracy,\n* excellent accuracy on low-cardinality sets,\n* fixed memory usage: no matter if there are tens or billions of unique values, memory usage only depends on the configured precision.\n\nFor a precision threshold of `c`, the implementation that we are using requires about `c * 8` bytes.\n\nThe following chart shows how the error varies before and after the threshold:\n\n![cardinality error](/reference/aggregations/images/cardinality_error.png \"\")\n\nFor all 3 thresholds, counts have been accurate up to the configured threshold. Although not guaranteed,\nthis is likely to be the case. Accuracy in practice depends on the dataset in question. In general,\nmost datasets show consistently good accuracy. Also note that even with a threshold as low as 100,\nthe error remains very low (1-6% as seen in the above graph) even when counting millions of items.\n\nThe HyperLogLog++ algorithm depends on the leading zeros of hashed values, the exact distributions of\nhashes in a dataset can affect the accuracy of the cardinality.\n\n## Pre-computed hashes [_pre_computed_hashes]\n\nOn string fields that have a high cardinality, it might be faster to store the hash of your field values in your index and then run the cardinality aggregation on this field. This can either be done by providing hash values from client-side or by letting Elasticsearch compute hash values for you by using the [`mapper-murmur3`](/reference/elasticsearch-plugins/mapper-murmur3.md) plugin.\n\n::::{note}\nPre-computing hashes is usually only useful on very large and/or high-cardinality fields as it saves CPU and memory. However, on numeric fields, hashing is very fast and storing the original values requires as much or less memory than storing the hashes. This is also true on low-cardinality string fields, especially given that those have an optimization in order to make sure that hashes are computed at most once per unique value per segment.\n::::\n\n\n\n## Script [_script_4]\n\nIf you need the cardinality of the combination of two fields, create a [runtime field](docs-content://manage-data/data-store/mapping/runtime-fields.md) combining them and aggregate it.\n\n```console\nPOST /sales/_search?size=0\n{\n  \"runtime_mappings\": {\n    \"type_and_promoted\": {\n      \"type\": \"keyword\",\n      \"script\": \"emit(doc['type'].value + ' ' + doc['promoted'].value)\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"type_promoted_count\": {\n      \"cardinality\": {\n        \"field\": \"type_and_promoted\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## Missing value [_missing_value_8]\n\nThe `missing` parameter defines how documents that are missing a value should be treated. By default they will be ignored but it is also possible to treat them as if they had a value.\n\n```console\nPOST /sales/_search?size=0\n{\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"tag_cardinality\": {\n      \"cardinality\": {\n        \"field\": \"tag\",\n        \"missing\": \"N/A\" <1>\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n1. Documents without a value in the `tag` field will fall into the same bucket as documents that have the value `N/A`.\n\n\n\n## Execution hint [_execution_hint_4]\n\nYou can run cardinality aggregations using different mechanisms:\n\n* by using field values directly (`direct`)\n* by using global ordinals of the field and resolving those values after finishing a shard (`global_ordinals`)\n* by using segment ordinal values and resolving those values after each segment (`segment_ordinals`)\n\nAdditionally, there are two \"heuristic based\" modes.  These modes will cause {{es}} to use some data about the state of the index to choose an appropriate execution method.  The two heuristics are:\n\n* `save_time_heuristic` - this is the default in {{es}} 8.4 and later.\n* `save_memory_heuristic` - this was the default in {{es}} 8.3 and earlier\n\nWhen not specified, {{es}} will apply a heuristic to choose the appropriate mode.  Also note that for some data (non-ordinal fields), `direct` is the only option, and the hint will be ignored in these cases.  Generally speaking, it should not be necessary to set this value.",

This is a configurable upper limit.\n\nTo overcome this limitation:\n\n* Reduce the result set size by modifying the query to only return relevant data. Use [`WHERE`](/reference/query-languages/esql/commands/where.md) to select a smaller subset of the data.\n* Shift any post-query processing to the query itself. You can use the {{esql}} [`STATS`](/reference/query-languages/esql/commands/stats-by.md) command to aggregate data in the query.\n\nThe upper limit only applies to the number of rows that are output by the query, not to the number of documents it processes: the query runs on the full data set.\n\nConsider the following two queries:\n```esql\nFROM index | WHERE field0 == \"value\" | LIMIT 20000\n```\nand\n```esql\nFROM index | STATS AVG(field1) BY field2 | LIMIT 20000\n```\n\nIn both cases, the filtering by `field0` in the first query or the grouping by `field2` in the second is applied over all the documents present in the `index`, irrespective of their number or indexes size.

A larger result-set involves a higher memory pressure and increased processing times; the internode traffic within and across clusters can also increase.\n\nThese limitations are similar to those enforced by the [search API for pagination](/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/paginate-search-results.md).\n\n| Functionality                    | Search                  | {{esql}}                                  |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Results returned by default      | 10                      | 1.000                                     |\n| Default upper limit              | 10,000                  | 10,000                                    |\n| Specify number of results        | `size`                  | `LIMIT`                                   |\n| Change default number of results | n/a                     | esql.query.result_truncation_default_size |\n| Change default upper limit       | index-max-result-window | esql.query.result_truncation_max_size     |",

Because caching is per segment, merging segments can invalidate cached queries.\n\nThe following setting is *static* and must be configured on every data node in the cluster:\n\n`indices.queries.cache.size`\n:   ([Static](docs-content://deploy-manage/stack-settings.md#static-cluster-setting)) Controls the memory size for the filter cache. Accepts either a percentage value, like `5%`, or an exact value, like `512mb`. Defaults to `10%`.\n\n## Query cache index settings [query-cache-index-settings]\n\nThe following setting is an *index* setting that can be configured on a per-index basis. Can only be set at index creation time or on a [closed index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-open):\n\n`index.queries.cache.enabled`\n:   ([Static](/reference/elasticsearch/index-settings/index.md)) Controls whether to enable query caching. Accepts `true` (default) or `false`.",

          "content": "The `breadth_first` collection mode in Elasticsearch is an option for aggregations that can affect memory overhead. When using this mode, the aggregation processes data across all shards but does so in a way that minimizes the memory footprint and maximizes the efficiency of aggregating large datasets.\n\n### Memory Overhead in `breadth_first` Mode\n\nHere's a breakdown of how memory overhead is managed and what to expect when using the `breadth_first` collection mode:\n\n1. **Reduced Memory Usage**: The primary advantage is that `breadth_first` processes aggregations in a way that avoids excessive memory usage that can occur with large datasets. It collects results in a more distributed manner across shards rather than aggregating them all at once, which can lead to high memory spikes.\n\n2. **Incremental Collection**: In `breadth_first` mode, partial results from each shard are computed first and then combined. This means that the memory required at any single point in time is lower compared to modes that attempt to aggregate all data simultaneously.\n\n3. **Sharded Approach**: By focusing on individual shards first, `breadth_first` effectively limits the amount of data any single node needs to handle upfront, therefore spreading out the memory usage across the cluster.\n\n4. **Trade-offs**: While it helps manage memory usage better, `breadth_first` might come with some overhead in terms of processing time due to the necessity of conducting operations in multiple steps instead of a single, more granular query processing. This can trade performance for lower memory usage.\n\n5. **Practical Applications**: This mode is particularly suited for queries involving large datasets or high cardinality fields where traditional aggregation methods would struggle under memory constraints.\n\nIf you're working with large datasets and facing memory issues, switching to `breadth_first` collection mode can be a valid approach to mitigate memory overhead while conducting aggregations.\n\n### References\n- For more in-depth information, you can refer to the [Elasticsearch documentation on aggregation requests](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/docs/reference/aggregation.md) which discusses collection modes and their characteristics.",
