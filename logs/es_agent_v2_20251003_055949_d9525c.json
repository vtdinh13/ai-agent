For example, using `TS` to designate a time series.\n\n2. **COUNT_OVER_TIME Function**: Use the `count_over_time(<field>)` function in your query to calculate the count for a specified field over a given time interval. This function is often nested within a `STATS` command.\n\n3. **Grouping and Time Bucketing**: Employ the `BY` clause to group your results. You'll also typically want to use a `bucket` function to define the time interval for aggregation. For instance, you can use `bucket(@timestamp, 1minute)` to group results into 1-minute intervals.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how these components come together in an ESQL query:\n\n```esql\nTS k8s\n| STATS count=count(count_over_time(network.cost)) BY cluster, time_bucket = bucket(@timestamp, 1minute)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `k8s` is the time series data source,\n- `count_over_time(network.cost)` calculates the counts for the `network.cost` field,\n- Results are aggregated based on the `cluster` and the specified time bucket of 1 minute.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation: [COUNT OVER TIME](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/elasticsearch-main/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/kibana/docs/functions/count_over_time.md).",
