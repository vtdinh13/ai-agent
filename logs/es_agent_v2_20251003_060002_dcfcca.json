              "content": "# _doc_count field [mapping-doc-count-field]\n\nBucket aggregations always return a field named `doc_count` showing the number of documents that were aggregated and partitioned in each bucket. Computation of the value of `doc_count` is very simple. `doc_count` is incremented by 1 for every document collected in each bucket.\n\nWhile this simple approach is effective when computing aggregations over individual documents, it fails to accurately represent documents that store pre-aggregated data (such as `histogram` or `aggregate_metric_double` fields), because one summary field may represent multiple documents.\n\nTo allow for correct computation of the number of documents when working with pre-aggregated data, we have introduced a metadata field type named `_doc_count`. `_doc_count` must always be a positive integer representing the number of documents aggregated in a single summary field.\n\nWhen field `_doc_count` is added to a document, all bucket aggregations will respect its value and increment the bucket `doc_count` by the value of the field. If a document does not contain any `_doc_count` field, `_doc_count = 1` is implied by default.\n\n::::{important}\n* A `_doc_count` field can only store a single positive integer per document. Nested arrays are not allowed.\n* If a document contains no `_doc_count` fields, aggregators will increment by 1, which is the default behavior.\n\n::::\n\n\n## Example [mapping-doc-count-field-example]\n\nThe following [create index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-indices-create) API request creates a new index with the following field mappings:\n\n* `my_histogram`, a `histogram` field used to store percentile data\n* `my_text`, a `keyword` field used to store a title for the histogram\n\n```console\nPUT my_index\n{\n  \"mappings\" : {\n    \"properties\" : {\n      \"my_histogram\" : {\n        \"type\" : \"histogram\"\n      },\n      \"my_text\" : {\n        \"type\" : \"keyword\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe following [index](https://www.elastic.co/docs/api/doc/elasticsearch/operation/operation-create) API requests store pre-aggregated data for two histograms: `histogram_1` and `histogram_2`.\n\n```console\nPUT my_index/_doc/1\n{\n  \"my_text\" : \"histogram_1\",\n  \"my_histogram\" : {\n      \"values\" : [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5],\n      \"counts\" : [3, 7, 23, 12, 6]\n   },\n  \"_doc_count\": 45 <1>\n}\n\nPUT my_index/_doc/2\n{\n  \"my_text\" : \"histogram_2\",\n  \"my_histogram\" : {\n      \"values\" : [0.1, 0.25, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5],\n      \"counts\" : [8, 17, 8, 7, 6, 2]\n   },\n  \"_doc_count\": 62 <1>\n}\n```\n\n1.

This can lead to surprising behavior, such as the sum of bucket counts being higher than the number of matched documents. For example, consider the following index:\n\n```console\nPUT range_index\n{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"number_of_shards\": 2\n  },\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"expected_attendees\": {\n        \"type\": \"integer_range\"\n      },\n      \"time_frame\": {\n        \"type\": \"date_range\",\n        \"format\": \"yyyy-MM-dd||epoch_millis\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPUT range_index/_doc/1?refresh\n{\n  \"expected_attendees\" : {\n    \"gte\" : 10,\n    \"lte\" : 20\n  },\n  \"time_frame\" : {\n    \"gte\" : \"2019-10-28\",\n    \"lte\" : \"2019-11-04\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe range is wider than the interval in the following aggregation, and thus the document will land in multiple buckets.\n\n$$$range-field-aggregation-example$$$\n\n```console\nPOST /range_index/_search?size=0\n{\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"range_histo\": {\n      \"histogram\": {\n        \"field\": \"expected_attendees\",\n        \"interval\": 5\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSince the interval is `5` (and the offset is `0` by default), we expect buckets `10`, `15`, and `20`. Our range document will fall in all three of these buckets.\n\n```console-result\n{\n  ...\n  \"aggregations\" : {\n    \"range_histo\" : {\n      \"buckets\" : [\n        {\n          \"key\" : 10.0,\n          \"doc_count\" : 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"key\" : 15.0,\n          \"doc_count\" : 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"key\" : 20.0,\n          \"doc_count\" : 1\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nA document cannot exist partially in a bucket; For example, the above document cannot count as one-third in each of the above three buckets. In this example, since the document\u2019s range landed in multiple buckets, the full value of that document would also be counted in any sub-aggregations for each bucket as well.\n\n\n## Query bounds are not aggregation filters [_query_bounds_are_not_aggregation_filters]\n\nAnother unexpected behavior can arise when a query is used to filter on the field being aggregated. In this case, a document could match the query but still have one or both of the endpoints of the range outside the query. Consider the following aggregation on the above document:\n\n$$$range-field-aggregation-query-bounds-example$$$\n\n```console\nPOST /range_index/_search?size=0\n{\n  \"query\": {\n    \"range\": {\n      \"time_frame\": {\n        \"gte\": \"2019-11-01\",\n        \"format\": \"yyyy-MM-dd\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"aggs\": {\n    \"november_data\": {\n      \"date_histogram\": {\n        \"field\": \"time_frame\",\n        \"calendar_interval\": \"day\",\n        \"format\": \"yyyy-MM-dd\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEven though the query only considers days in November, the aggregation generates 8 buckets (4 in October, 4 in November) because the aggregation is calculated over the ranges of all matching documents.\n\n```console-result\n{\n  ...\n  \"aggregations\" : {\n    \"november_data\" : {\n      \"buckets\" : [\n              {\n          \"key_as_string\" : \"2019-10-28\",\n          \"key\" : 1572220800000,\n          \"doc_count\" : 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"key_as_string\" : \"2019-10-29\",\n          \"key\" : 1572307200000,\n          \"doc_count\" : 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"key_as_string\" : \"2019-10-30\",\n          \"key\" : 1572393600000,\n          \"doc_count\" : 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"key_as_string\" : \"2019-10-31\",\n          \"key\" : 1572480000000,\n          \"doc_count\" : 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"key_as_string\" : \"2019-11-01\",\n          \"key\" : 1572566400000,\n          \"doc_count\" : 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"key_as_string\" : \"2019-11-02\",\n          \"key\" : 1572652800000,\n          \"doc_count\" : 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"key_as_string\" : \"2019-11-03\",\n          \"key\" : 1572739200000,\n          \"doc_count\" : 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"key_as_string\" : \"2019-11-04\",\n          \"key\" : 1572825600000,\n          \"doc_count\" : 1\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDepending on the use case, a `CONTAINS` query could limit the documents to only those that fall entirely in the queried range. In this example, the one document would not be included and the aggregation would be empty. Filtering the buckets after the aggregation is also an option, for use cases where the document should be counted but the out of bounds data can be safely ignored.",

In this case, the document could be contributing to an aggregation but might not be individually counted as it's assumed to represent multiple documents due to its summary nature.\n\n2. **Absence of Changes to Time Frame**: The `COUNT_OVER_TIME` function is designed to calculate counts based on a time bucket. If the timestamps of events contained in the document do not fall within the selected time frames for the aggregation or if there are no new events for a specific period, the count may remain unchanged.\n\n3. **Missing `_doc_count` Field**: If the document lacks the `_doc_count` field, it defaults to assuming its doc count as 1. Therefore, if the inherent values or conditions do not require any change, the document will effectively remain unchanged in terms of its contributions to the count.\n\n4. **Aggregation Range Issues**: When querying data that involve multiple ranges, a document might land in multiple buckets but remain counted as unchanged for specific aggregations or time windows depending on how the ranges are defined and processed.\n\n5. **Incorporations of Filters**: If the query or filters applied to the `COUNT_OVER_TIME` function don't match the conditions necessary to trigger changes (like excluding certain buckets or time frames), the data from certain documents may not reflect changes even if they are still relevant to the overall data set being analyzed.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the documentation regarding the function and its context in Elasticsearch:\n- [COUNT_OVER_TIME function](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/main/elasticsearch-main/docs/reference/query-languages/esql/kibana/docs/functions/count_over_time.md)",
