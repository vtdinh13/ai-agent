Defaults to `true`.\n\n\n## {{api-examples-title}} [indices-create-index-from-source-api-example]\n\nStart by creating a source index that we\u2019ll copy using this API.\n\n```console\nPUT /my-index\n{\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"index\": {\n      \"number_of_shards\": 3,\n      \"blocks.write\": true\n    }\n  },\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"field1\": { \"type\": \"text\" }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow we create a destination index from the source index. This new index will have the same mappings and settings as the source index.\n\n```console\nPOST _create_from/my-index/my-new-index\n```\n\nAlternatively, we could override some of the source\u2019s settings and mappings. This will use the source settings and mappings as a basis and combine these with the overrides to create the destination settings and mappings.\n\n```console\nPOST _create_from/my-index/my-new-index\n{\n  \"settings_override\": {\n    \"index\": {\n      \"number_of_shards\": 5\n    }\n  },\n  \"mappings_override\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"field2\": { \"type\": \"boolean\" }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSince the destination index is empty, we very likely will want to write into the index after creation. This would not be possible if the source index contains an [index write block](/reference/elasticsearch/index-settings/index-block.md) which is copied over to the destination index. One way to handle this is to remove the index write block using a settings override. For example, the following settings override removes all index blocks.\n\n```console\nPOST _create_from/my-index/my-new-index\n{\n  \"settings_override\": {\n    \"index\": {\n      \"blocks.write\": null,\n      \"blocks.read\": null,\n      \"blocks.read_only\": null,\n      \"blocks.read_only_allow_delete\": null,\n      \"blocks.metadata\": null\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSince this is a common scenario, index blocks are actually removed by default. This is controlled with the parameter `remove_index_blocks`, which defaults to `true`. If we want the destination index to contains the index blocks from the source index, we can do the following:\n\n```console\nPOST _create_from/my-index/my-new-index\n{\n  \"remove_index_blocks\": false\n}\n```",

          "content": "To assign an index to nodes with a specific custom attribute in Elasticsearch, you can use the concepts of index routing and custom attributes during the indexing process. Here\u2019s a general approach:\n\n### Steps to Assign an Index Based on Custom Attributes\n\n1. **Define Your Custom Attributes**: You need to ensure that you have your custom attributes defined for the nodes. This can typically be done in the settings of the cluster.\n\n2. **Using Routing**: You can utilize the `_routing` field to control which shard (and thus which node) a document will be indexed into, based on your custom attribute. For instance, when indexing documents, you can direct them to nodes that meet specific criteria.\n\n3. **Reindexing and Custom Routing**: If you need to change the index or assign it to nodes based on attributes later, you could perform a reindex operation. During this operation, you can modify the `ctx['_index']` variable in your Painless script. This allows you to direct documents into different indexes based on their custom attributes.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how this might look in practice:\n\n- **Directing Indexing with Custom Attributes**\n   - When you index a document, you can specify the routing value:\n     ```json\n     POST /{index}/_doc?routing={custom_attribute}\n     {\n       \"field\": \"value\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n- **Using Painless During Reindex**\n   - If you are reindexing and want a change based on a condition:\n     ```json\n     POST _reindex\n     {\n       \"source\": {\n         \"index\": \"source_index\"\n       },\n       \"dest\": {\n         \"index\": \"dest_index\"\n       },\n       \"script\": {\n         \"source\": \"\"\"\n           if (ctx['_source'].custom_field == 'desired_value') {\n             ctx['_index'] = 'new_index_name';\n           }\n         \"\"\",\n         \"lang\": \"painless\"\n       }\n     }\n     ```\n\n### Key Considerations\n- Make sure that the attribute you are using for routing is always present in the documents being indexed or handled.\n- The `_index` field allows you to control which index a document is sent to during a reindex operation.\n\nFor more detailed information on routing and the Painless scripting language, you can check out the following sections in the Elasticsearch documentation:\n\n- [Mapping Index Field](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-index-field.html) - Discusses routing and indexing strategies.\n- [Reindex Context](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/painless/current/painless-reindex-context.html) - Covers the Painless scripting context used during reindexing.\n\nFeel free to explore these resources for deeper insights into how routing and indexing work in Elasticsearch based on custom attributes.",
